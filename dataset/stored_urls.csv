203,Bitcoin,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/top/,715,Reddit - Dive into anything,,"I originally bought my first Bitcoins in 2012, while living in Europe, as a means for buying substances of ill repute.  At any given time, I had several of them in an online wallet (don’t even remember where). I eventually stopped partying so much, but still had 3-4 laying around.  By the time I moved back to the US in 2015, I remembered the wallet and was shocked to see that what was originally maybe $50 worth of coins had turned into something like $1500. I didn’t understand it, but that is when I started reading more about it.  I would talk about it with friends and try to convince them to buy.  I eventually built my stack up to about 7 bitcoins by late 2017. As the price soared, I kept imagining my life as a millionaire.  When the crash happened, I forgot all about its cyclic nature and panicked, selling 4 of them around the $7K mark.  I invested that $30K and left the 3 remaining bitcoins in my wallet.  And they stayed there for 6 more years.  In 2023, I sold another one for about $25K to help pay for my wedding. At that point I vowed to not sell my last 2 until it mooned.  Today, my wife and I did something we never thought possible - we made an offer on an investment property.  It was accepted tonight and I sold my last two remaining bitcoins, for just shy of $200K so that I had the funds for a down payment."
