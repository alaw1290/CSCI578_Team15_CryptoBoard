Bitcoin,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/top/,715,Reddit - Dive into anything,,"I originally bought my first Bitcoins in 2012, while living in Europe, as a means for buying substances of ill repute.  At any given time, I had several of them in an online wallet (don’t even remember where). I eventually stopped partying so much, but still had 3-4 laying around.  By the time I moved back to the US in 2015, I remembered the wallet and was shocked to see that what was originally maybe $50 worth of coins had turned into something like $1500. I didn’t understand it, but that is when I started reading more about it.  I would talk about it with friends and try to convince them to buy.  I eventually built my stack up to about 7 bitcoins by late 2017. As the price soared, I kept imagining my life as a millionaire.  When the crash happened, I forgot all about its cyclic nature and panicked, selling 4 of them around the $7K mark.  I invested that $30K and left the 3 remaining bitcoins in my wallet.  And they stayed there for 6 more years.  In 2023, I sold another one for about $25K to help pay for my wedding. At that point I vowed to not sell my last 2 until it mooned.  Today, my wife and I did something we never thought possible - we made an offer on an investment property.  It was accepted tonight and I sold my last two remaining bitcoins, for just shy of $200K so that I had the funds for a down payment."

I was wondering if crypto actually had any practical uses that are implemented in this day and age. For me and where I live almost no one has crypto or uses it on anything, the ones ik who have it just have it as an investment, but im curious if it has any uses in your countries, and if its just a problem here.

I know crypto has been on a rise lately and bitcoin is almost at 100k now, but my thoughts are if crypto has no uses anywhere that I can't imagine it being there decades or so from now, it might not die anytime soon but still. On the other hand if it is being used in other parts of the world I can see it surviving and continuing to thrive.


EDIT: Just to clarify im just looking for a reason why crypto will be relevant in a few decades. For example do you imagine crypto will be there in 40 years? If so, why? And how would you imagine it will look like in that time?"

This includes unused real estate, luxury goods, and digital assets (they used BTC as an example - many times)

This proposal came up during discussions on the 2025 Finance Bill and again they used Bitcoin as an example to illustrate the tax's potential range. The purpose of the tax is to capture wealth from assets that dont contribute to economic productivity

A preliminary vote (EMPHASIS ON PRELIMINARY) on this amendment was held on November 26 where only supporting senators were in the chamber - the vote passed in this setting but it doesnt represent the final say yet. The amendment still needs to survive more legislative scrutiny before actually becoming law

If this proposal moves forward then EU is risking isolating itself as a continent unable to keep up with innovation - maybe even driving talent and capital elsewhere

Here is the amendment (its in French obviously): [https://www.senat.fr/amendements/2024-2025/143/Amdt\_I-128.html](https://www.senat.fr/amendements/2024-2025/143/Amdt_I-128.html)

Now we have Solana and avalanche which I believe are similar cryptos but since I don’t understand them or their actual use cases I don’t know how to pick which one I want to own.

So my main question is what books or articles or websites do you guys recommend for me to learn more about this. I want to learn enough that I understand this stuff fully. I want to be able to explain what a smart contract is and what etheriums utility is."

This period of market growth coincided with the widespread adoption of the World Wide Web and the Internet, resulting in a dispensation of available venture capital and the rapid growth of valuations in new dot-com startups. Between 1995 and its peak in March 2000, investments in the NASDAQ composite stock market index rose by 800%, only to fall 78% from its peak by October 2002, giving up all its gains during the bubble.""

The above is from Wikipedia. Just a FYI for those who maybe not be familiar with it. 

I think because crypto is new, many coins are like  dot-com startups. 

When (/if) the bubble pops, the only coins that will be left standing will be bitcoin as a store of wealth, and coins that have established RWA. 

What are your thoughts? If you agree, what coins do you think will be here for the long run?  Like the dot-com companies that survived due to thier RWA and are now thriving."

Look, I'm not gonna deny that some shady practices exist in this industry, but the documentary is seriously biased. James basically attacks Bitcoin and NFTs purely from an investment angle.

The video's got weak sources and a narrative that's super repetitive—exactly what we see in typical mass media. It's funny how ""tech influencers"" like Marques Brownlee end up backing this kind of content. It just shows how killer video editing and smooth storytelling can blow up on YouTube, even when the research is trash.

The really sad part? This video has over 6 million views. That means tons of people who know nothing about Bitcoin are getting fed this narrative.

So, if you're new to this whole crypto world, I'm gonna point you to an article I wrote on Hackernoon: [The 6M Views Crypto Documentary That Got It Wrong](https://hackernoon.com/the-6m-views-crypto-documentary-that-got-it-wrong).

My piece breaks down the holes in James's arguments. And just to be clear—I'm not trying to sell you on investing in Bitcoin or NFTs. I just want to give you a more realistic take on the industry. The article digs into blockchain technology and its actual value, instead of throwing around investment advice.

I'm totally open to discussion. Want to tear apart my perspective? Go for it. Bring your sources, and I'll be happy to hear them out."

With initial plans for a memecoin launchpad built on DOGE. Bringing with it the possibilities associated with DOGE now being connected to Bitcoin through RGB++

RGB++ has been receiving a lot of interest recently from both the Bitcoin and Asian crypto communities after having first being built for Bitcoin and its very novel approach of 'Isomorphic binding' which requires no actual bridge to the other chain but rather, mapping 2 chains along side each other.

**Quote from recent Techflow article:**

>It is reported that RGB++ will support the $Doge chain in the next step, and will launch the Meme launchpad on the Doge chain after the launch of BTC Meme launchpad. At the same time, he also said that the lightning network is the strategic direction of CKB's long-term layout, which will greatly increase the competitive advantage of the RGB++ protocol. It is worth noting that at present, many teams are not only focusing on the development of the protocol itself, but also promoting the compatibility of their protocols with lightning networks, such as Taproot Assets and RGB. Up to now, RGB++ ecological Meme leading coin SEAL has risen by 50% in 24 hours, and CKB has risen by 12%.

**INTRODUCTION TO RGB++**

RGB++ is an extension protocol based on RGB, utilizing single-use seals and client-side validation technology to manage state changes and transaction verification. It maps UTXOs to Nervos CKB Cells via isomorphic bindings and uses script constraints on the CKB and the other chain to verify the correctness of state computation and the validity of ownership changes.

RGB++ addresses the technical challenges faced by the original RGB protocol in practical implementation and provides more possibilities, such as blockchain-enhanced client validation, transaction folding, shared states with ownerless contracts, and non-interactive transfers. It brings Turing-complete contract extensions and performance enhancements to other UTXO chains without the need for cross-chain transfers or compromising security.

I’m the kind of person you’d label *that insane schizo conspiracy theorist*. The one you’d laugh at, mock in group chats, or call delusional in Reddit threads. That’s fine. I’m used to it. But here’s the thing about “crazy” people—they’re often the first to see patterns others ignore. So laugh all you want, but in a few years, when the dust settles, I’ll be the one saying, “I told you so.”

What am I talking about? Bitcoin. The dollar. Wealth inequality. The future of money. Let me show you a blueprint for a system that’s being built right in front of your eyes—one that most of you either don’t see or refuse to believe. You’ll probably roll your eyes and call me crazy, but remember this moment when it all starts happening.

# Bitcoin’s Origins: A Perfectly Timed “Solution”

Let’s start with Bitcoin’s origin story. It’s 2008—the financial crisis has shattered trust in banks and governments. Amid this chaos, a pseudonymous figure named Satoshi Nakamoto releases the Bitcoin white paper, promising a decentralized, deflationary currency immune to manipulation. People eat it up. It’s the ultimate middle finger to the establishment, right?

But let’s think critically here. **How convenient is it that Bitcoin emerged precisely when global trust in centralized systems was at an all-time low?** Too convenient. Timing matters, and the timing of Bitcoin’s release feels less like a coincidence and more like an engineered response.

And let’s not ignore Bitcoin’s technological roots. The SHA-256 algorithm, which secures Bitcoin’s blockchain, was developed by the NSA. While SHA-256 is open-source and widely used, it’s not a stretch to suggest the U.S. government may have had a hand in shaping Bitcoin’s foundations. After all, who benefits most from a digital, transparent, and traceable financial system? (Yes, I said traceable—because don’t let anyone fool you into thinking Bitcoin is truly anonymous. It’s pseudonymous, and every transaction is permanently etched onto a public ledger.)

If you’re still with me, here’s the kicker: The U.S. government didn’t need to announce Bitcoin as their creation. They let it grow organically, fueled by libertarian ideals and distrust in the system. They knew people would adopt it out of rebellion, unknowingly building the infrastructure for the very financial surveillance system they feared.

# Proof of Adoption: The Quiet Infiltration by the Elite

Now, let’s talk about what’s happened since. Bitcoin, once a niche experiment for tech enthusiasts, has grown into a trillion-dollar asset class. And here’s where it gets interesting: the very institutions Bitcoin was supposed to undermine are now its biggest backers.

* **BlackRock**: The world’s largest asset manager, with deep ties to governments and central banks, has been filing for Bitcoin ETFs and pushing institutional adoption. Fun fact: BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, was once critical of Bitcoin, calling it a tool for money laundering. Now? He’s all-in. Ask yourself: why the sudden 180-degree shift?
* **MicroStrategy**: Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, has been one of Bitcoin’s loudest advocates, investing billions of corporate funds into BTC. This isn’t just a corporate strategy—it’s part of a larger trend of institutions quietly accumulating Bitcoin while the average person hesitates.
* **Fidelity and Other Financial Giants**: Companies like Fidelity have been laying the groundwork for institutional Bitcoin adoption for years. These firms don’t make moves without inside knowledge or government alignment.

The narrative is clear: **Bitcoin is no longer the “people’s currency.”** It’s being hoarded by the same elite entities that control traditional finance. And if you think governments aren’t involved, you’re kidding yourself. They’re just letting their proxies—companies like BlackRock—do the dirty work.

# Why the U.S. Government Needs Bitcoin

Here’s where the puzzle pieces really come together. The U.S. dollar is in decline. Inflation is eroding its value, national debt is skyrocketing, and global rivals like China and Russia are pushing for alternatives. BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) are even developing their own reserve currency to challenge the dollar’s dominance.

The U.S. government knows this. They know the dollar’s days as the global reserve currency are numbered. And what’s the best way to transition out of a failing system? **Control the replacement before your rivals do.**

Bitcoin offers a solution:

1. **Deflationary Economics**: With its fixed supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is immune to inflation. This makes it an attractive reserve asset for nations and institutions.
2. **Global Neutrality**: Bitcoin isn’t tied to any one country, making it a perfect candidate for a new global financial system—one that the U.S. can influence quietly through early accumulation.
3. **Debt Reset Potential**: If Bitcoin’s value skyrockets (say, to $1 million or more per coin), governments holding large reserves could sell portions to pay off national debt or fund programs. It’s a clean slate for a broken system.

# The Trap of Bitcoin “Freedom”

But here’s the kicker: while Bitcoin appears to promise financial freedom, it’s also a Trojan Horse for unprecedented control. Governments aren’t just sitting idly by—they’re developing **Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)** to complement or even compete with Bitcoin. These CBDCs will:

* Be programmable, meaning governments can control how you spend your money.
* Be trackable, erasing any semblance of financial privacy.
* Tie directly to social systems, potentially linking your finances to things like credit scores or even social behavior.

Here’s the twisted beauty of it: Bitcoin will pave the way for mass adoption of digital currencies. Once people are comfortable with Bitcoin, governments will step in with CBDCs, offering stability and convenience. And by then, it’ll be too late. You’ll already be trapped in the system.

# Wealth Inequality and the New World Order

Let’s not sugarcoat this: Bitcoin will make some people unimaginably rich. But who benefits most? Early adopters and institutions. The average person, who buys in late or doesn’t buy at all, will be left behind. This isn’t an accident—it’s by design.

When fiat currencies collapse and Bitcoin takes center stage, the wealth divide will become unbridgeable. The elites will hold Bitcoin, land, and other hard assets. The rest? They’ll own depreciating fiat and worthless debt. This isn’t just financial inequality—it’s systemic anarchy, a world where power consolidates further into the hands of the few.

# But I Know What You’re Thinking…

“Schizo ramblings,” right? “This guy’s insane.” Sure. Laugh it up. Call me crazy. But just remember: every major upheaval in history was dismissed as impossible until it happened. People laughed at those who warned about the 2008 financial crisis. They laughed at Snowden’s revelations about mass surveillance. And they’re laughing now at the idea that Bitcoin is anything other than a benevolent invention.

But when you’re watching Bitcoin hit seven figures, when the dollar is collapsing, and when governments are rolling out CBDCs with a smile, just remember this post. I’ll be back to say, “I told you so.”

# One Final Thought

You don’t have to believe me. In fact, I don’t expect you to. But start asking questions. Why are institutions hoarding Bitcoin? Why are governments tolerating something that supposedly threatens their power? And why is a system built on “decentralization” being quietly co-opted by the very entities it was meant to replace?

Think critically. Connect the dots. And when the pieces fall into place, just remember: you heard it here first."

***Proof-of-Work***

The first approach is proof-of-work, famously used by Nakamoto for Bitcoin and inherited by many other blockchains. In this approach, at a very high level, users race to solve a very complex cryptographic puzzle. The first one to solve the puzzle has the right to append the next block to the chain. Proof-of-Work suffers from several flaws.

*First Flaw: Proof-of-Work Does Not Scale.* Proof-of-work is very slow. Bitcoin’s crypto puzzles are so hard in order to guarantee that one solution is found only every 10 minutes, no matter how many miners try to solve the crypto puzzle. We can understand expensive and fast. But expensive and slow is hard to understand. The world is a large place and one block of transactions every 10 minutes is hardly enough.

*Second Flaw: Proof-of-Work Results in De-Facto Centralization.* Proof-of-work has caused a tremendous concentration of power. This centralization is a consequence of the fact that Proof-of-Work is both expensive and wasteful. The amount of computation performed by the *miners* — that is, the users trying to solve the crypto puzzles —is stunning. Mining today utilizes racks and racks of specialized hardware and consumes an enormous amount of electricity. One miner wins the race and generates the new block, and the efforts of all the others are wasted. Without the subsidies that Bitcoin currently offers, the cost of posting a single transaction on Bitcoin’s blockchain is around $20. Not the way to go if you want to use the blockchain for everyday transactions like buying a slice of pizza or if you want to use it offer financial services to those 2.2 billion who are currently not served by the financial system.

The common user would lose money if she tried to solve the crypto puzzle with her laptop. Win or lose, she must pay for the electricity necessary to power the computations of her laptop. This amount of electricity may not be big, but her probability of winning is so small that, in expectation, she would lose money.

Only professional miners, who have made the capital expenditure necessary to buy racks and racks of hyper specialized mining equipment, can expect to make a small profit. Accordingly, only they participate in block generation. Furthermore, miners consociate in *mining pools*.

Today, Bitcoin’s blockchain is controlled by just three mining pools and Ethereum’s by just two mining pools. If they so decide, or if they are bribed to do so, these mining pools can rewrite the database: they can erase blocks or change the order of blocks. Proof-of-work has turned what was intended to be a decentralized system into an extremely centralized one.

*Third Flaw: Proof-of-Work Is Not Secure.* As we said, any blockchain that is centralized, whether by design or *de facto*, is insecure. But proof-of-work has additional vulnerabilities, and it is especially vulnerable to network attacks. A blockchain ultimately is a communication protocol, and any such protocol is executed over an underlying communication network. An adversary may thus attack either the protocol — e.g., by sending messages that are different from the prescribed ones — or the communication network itself — e.g., by interfering with routers, cables, etc.

Just how insecure proof-of-work is may be underestimated because the current way of analyzing a blockchain’s security is flawed. This analysis typically focuses only on protocol attacks and neglects network attacks that, especially in the context of proof-of-work, can be deadly. For instance, in a proof-of-work blockchain, an adversary capable of partitioning the communication network for an hour or two could double-spend with impunity. In a successful partitioning attack, an adversary prevents the messages sent by the users belonging to a set of users A from reaching the users in a separate set B, and vice versa. Network partitioning has not attracted much attention, because it is considered too expensive to be practical. But the cost of a network attack may be justified, once the gains are high enough. A truly borderless economy may be valued in trillions of dollars. And an adversary may be willing to ‘invest’ millions of dollars, if he stands to illicitly gain billions of dollars.

*Fourth Flaw: Forks.* Another disadvantage of proof-of-work is the unavoidable existence of *forks*. Whenever two or more users solve the crypto puzzles within a few seconds of each other, the chain branches because users may now see multiple candidates for the next block. A fork may continue to exist for a while, and all its branches may even be elongated by the addition of new blocks. But eventually, all branches but one will die, and all the blocks in the dead branches will disappear.

Forks are an unwelcome source of uncertainty and delay. If a payment made to you appears in the latest block added to the chain, you cannot consider yourself paid and ship the goods. This is so because some branch may overcome the current chain and your block may end up in a dead branch and vanish. Before considering yourself paid, you would need to wait for a sequence of blocks to be added to yours, so as to minimize the chance that a soft fork will arise and the block containing your payment will end up on a dead branch.

How long should you wait for? Some people recommend six blocks to be added after yours to be confident that your block will remain on the chain. Others recommend an even longer wait, if the payment made to you is sizable. Thus, rather than waiting ten minutes, to have reasonable confidence in the finality of a transaction, in reality you have to wait hours.

Some people have suggested making the crypto puzzles easier in order to speed up the process, for instance by making it possible to find a solution every minute, rather than every 10 minutes. However, by doing so, the probability of getting two solutions within a few seconds of each other increases significantly. The system can cope with an occasional soft fork, but not with very frequent forks.

Expenses, slowness, and uncertainty are indeed major flaws in the proof-of-work approach, but they pale in comparison with its fatal flaw.

*The Fatal Flaw in Proof-of-Work.* Recall the already discussed fatal flaw: *the whole economy is at the mercy of a small part of the economy.*

In proof-of-work, this small part of the economy is that owned by the miners. Since the miners own only a small fraction of the money in a proof-of-work blockchain, the chain is not secure.

***Delegated Proof-of-Stake***

A different approach is delegated proof-of-stake (PoS). This is a very simple idea. The community empowers a few special users, the *delegates*, to choose the next block, at least for a while. (For example, in EOS, the number of the delegates is 21.)

Delegated PoS is, therefore, centralized from the get-go. Hopefully, the chosen delegates are honest to begin with. However, relying on delegates remaining honest for a long time is risky.

Once again, we have that *the whole economy is at the mercy of a small part of the economy.* Indeed, in a delegated-PoS blockchain the delegates may own a tiny fraction of the total money in the system, yet the whole blockchain is secure if and only if the majority of delegates are honest.

*Additional Security Problems.* Even assuming that there is an ironclad guarantee that all the delegates will remain honest forever, they can easily be attacked. In particular, they can be brought down by a denial of service (DoS) attack. In such an attack, an adversary bombards any user of his choice with zillions of junk messages, causing the buffer of that unfortunate user to overflow. If a delegate were so bombarded, he would be unable to perform his job, namely collating new and valid transactions into the next block. The blockchain would grind to a halt.

DoS attacks are quite cheap and can be mounted instantly against not only 21 people but even 1000 people. Since delegates are known, even if they were kept in power for just a day or an hour or a minute, a determined adversary could bring down all the delegates by a fast DoS attack.

***Bonded Proof-of-Stake***

Bonded PoS allows 20 users, 200 users, as many as are willing, to put some money on the table — a bond — where they can no longer touch it. These are the users who select the next block on behalf of all of us. If they misbehave, their money is confiscated.

Does this approach work?

Let me ask a simpler question: how much of your disposable income can you afford to put hostage on the table? The answer is a very small amount. Bonded PoS therefore, not only makes it possible, but actually makes it *easy* for big thieves with deep pockets to put a disproportionate amount of money on the table for the sole purpose of controlling the blockchain.

But so what? If they misbehave, they lose their hostage money. However, a truly decentralized, scalable and secure blockchain should secure trillions of dollars in assets. And by misbehaving, a malicious user stands to make a few billion dollars. This being the case, do you think that he may fear having a few million dollars confiscated? This is just the price of doing business. And it is a small price at that.

Once more, in bonded PoS, we have the same fatal flaw: *the whole economy is at the mercy of a small part of the economy.* Indeed, in a bonded PoS this small part of the economy consists of (the owners of) “the money laying hostage on the table.”

In sum, prior approaches suffer from several drawbacks. We need a better design.

**Algorand’s Logic and Pure Proof-of-Stake.** Algorand’s logic is simple: it ties the security of the whole economy to the honesty of the *majority* of the economy, and makes it impossible for a small subset of the economy to control the fate of the whole economy.

Algorand is based on a new Proof-of-Stake: *Pure* *PoS*. Essentially, a Pure PoS does not try to keep users honest by the fear of imposing fines. Rather, it makes cheating by a minority of the money impossible and cheating by a majority of the money stupid.

In Algorand no money is ever hostage. All money is always where it should be: in your wallet, at your fingertips ready to be spent, or in the various financial instruments that the Algorand blockchain offers you. When you take in consideration all the money in the system, wherever it may be, the system is secure when most of the money is in honest hands.

As we said, it is impossible for the owners of a small fraction of the money to harm the whole system, and it would be silly for the owners of the majority of the money to misbehave so as to devalue their own holdings.

For example, in proof-of-work or bonded PoS, a few users can prevent other users from transacting. In Algorand, only the owners of the majority of the money could prevent other users from transacting. But if they did so, the reputation of the currency would be greatly harmed, the currency would no longer universally accepted, and its purchasing power would be greatly diminished. Not a good outcome for the owners of the majority of the money.

**Implementing Pure PoS.** Let us now see how Algorand uses pure PoS for choosing the next block. Remember the trilemma? We want block generation to be simultaneously scalable, secure, and decentralized.

At a very high level, in Algorand, a new block is constructed in two phases.

* In the first phase, a single token is randomly selected, and its owner is the user who proposes the next block.
* In the second phase, 1000 tokens are selected among all tokens currently in the system. The owners of these 1000 tokens are selected to be part of a phase-2 ‘committee,’ which approves the block proposed by the first user.

Accordingly, some member of the committee may be chosen twice or more generally some k times, in which case, that member will have k votes in the committee to approve the next block.

Why is the second phase necessary?

In any society, and blockchains are no exception, there is always a small percentage of bad actors to be found; let us say 1 percent. Maybe 2 percent. If one is unfortunate enough to live in a very dangerous society, 10 percent may be bad actors. Perhaps even 20 percent! But in no society will bad actors be in a majority; otherwise, there would not be a society. A society exists insofar as the majority of its members follow prescribed rules.

Assume that 10 percent of the tokens in Algorand belong to dishonest people. Then, one in ten times, the user selected in phase 1 to propose a block may be a bad actor. Accordingly, he may tell some users that the block is X and other users that the block is Y and so on and so forth, thereby creating disagreement about what the blockchain is.

Phase 2 eliminates this problem. Indeed, if you select at random 1000 tokens when at most 10 percent of the tokens are in dishonest hands, the probability that the majority of the selected coins belong to bad actors, that is, the probability that the majority of the committee’s votes are cast by bad actors is so low as to be negligible.

Assume that, this time around, you have not been selected to propose a block. Nor have you been selected to be part of a committee to approve a proposed block. But you see that a given block B has been approved by, say, 700 votes of the committee. Then, you know that B is indeed the next block.

**A Key Question.** At this high-level description, several questions naturally arise. Let us start with the most obvious one: *Who randomly chooses the committee?*

Suppose I tell you that I do. Then you might say “That is the most centralized system ever, and you are at the center of it!” Suppose I tell you that all users discuss until they agree on a thousand committee members who then agree on the block. Then you might tell me that, humanity being what it is, an entire lifetime is not going to be enough to select the thousand committee members that we require.

Algorand takes an unorthodox approach: *the committee members select themselves.* You may think “What? That is a terrible idea! Because if I am a bad actor, I am going to select myself to be a member of this committee. And the next. And the one after that…” But not so fast.

To belong to the committee, one of your coins must win an individual, cryptographically fair lottery that you run in isolation — that is, without talking to anyone else — in the privacy of your own computer. And since the lottery is cryptographically fair, you cannot alter the chances of being selected in the slightest. (Not even a nation state with huge computational resources would be able to increase the probability of being selected.)

To select 1,000 random tokens among, say, 10,000,000,000 tokens, each token is selected with probability 1,000/10,000,000,000 — i.e., with probability 1 in 10 million.

So, as soon as a user sees a block being proposed, she asks herself: can I be a member of the committee selected to approve a block? And how many votes will I have?

To answer these questions, she runs the cryptographic lottery on her laptop for each one of the tokens that she owns. (If a user has n tokens, additional technology essentially allows her to run a single lottery instead of n separate lotteries!)

Once a user runs her lottery, one of two cases occurs. Either none of her tokens wins the lottery, in which case whatever opinion she expresses about the block will be ignored. Or some k>1of her tokens win the lottery, in which case, she obtains a winning ticket, namely a short proof that everybody can easily verify that she has k votes in the committee. In this latter case, she propagates through the network (i) a winning ticket proving that she has k votes and (ii) her opinion about the block.

**Solving the Trilemma**. Let me argue that this sketched approach is — finally! — simultaneously scalable, secure, and decentralized.

*Scalability.*

How long does it take for a user to run her own lottery? Roughly a microsecond, no matter how many tokens she has. That is indeed superfast. (Additionally, all the lotteries are run independently of each other, so that no user has to wait for other users to finish running their lotteries.)

Once selected, each member propagates to the network a single, short and immediately computed message. So no matter how many users are in the system, the maximum number of messages that need to be propagated is 1000 short messages. Is this scalable? Yes!

*Security.*

Now we come to security. Assume that I am a very powerful adversary, capable of corrupting users extremely quickly whenever I want. Clearly, I would love to corrupt the members of the committee, but I have a problem: I do not know who they are.

This is so because committee members are selected by a secretly run, cryptographically fair, individual lottery. Thus, only they know who they are, up to the moment in which they propagate through the network both their winning tickets and their opinions about the block. Only at that time I might learn who the committee members are and, given my super powers, I can immediately corrupt the entire committee. But so what? Corrupting them at this time is too late. Whatever the committee members had to say, they have already said, and their winning tickets and up-or-down opinions about the block are virally propagating throughout the network. I have no more power to put their messages back in the bottle than a government has the power to put back in the bottle messages virally propagated by WikiLeaks.

In other words, the Algorand approach is secure because beforehand, an adversary does not know whom to corrupt, and by the time he does, corruption is useless.

Contrast this with having a fixed 1000-strong committee. As discussed before, even if the committee stayed in power for a minute, it would be vulnerable to a DoS attack. If the committee stayed in power for much longer, say a week, then the members could even be corrupted in the physical world via traditional means such as bribes. In Algorand’s case however, one would not know against whom to mount a DoS attack and once the committee has spoken, the DoS attack is useless.

*Decentralization.*

Finally, we come to decentralization. Are there a few users in charge of choosing the next block? No, there are not. Nor is there a fixed, 1000-strong, committee in charge of approving the block. This time, a committee has been randomly (and secretly) selected. Next time, a different committee will be randomly (and secretly) selected. Everybody has the chance of participating in the generation of a new block.

*Algorand’s Non-Forkable Chain.*

An additional advantage of Algorand’s technology is that its chain never forks. This is so because only one block can have the required threshold of committee votes. Accordingly, in Algorand all transactions are final. Once a block appears, you can count on it to be forever part of the chain. And if the new block contains a payment made to you, you may consider yourself paid and send the goods immediately.

The financial world has already its own risks and there is no need to burden it with the additional uncertainty of \`block disappearance.’ By the way, when I said that Algorand’s chain never forks, I somewhat lied. Indeed, forks may occur in Algorand but they are very rare. The probability of forking in Algorand is, by design, 10⁻¹⁸. This probability may appear a strange choice, but it actually has a natural explanation. Physicists tell us that 10¹⁸ happens to be the number of seconds from the Big Bang until now. In other words, if you produce a block a second, a very good clip by the way, you may see a soft fork, but you would have to wait for the lifetime of the universe to see it."

The project launched in April and team members have worked for European Central Bank developing CBDCs (according to the team). They aren't publicly doxed yet but have doxed privately to Certik: https://skynet.certik.com/projects/opengpu. The token is currently at 60mil market cap and will be migrated to the L1 within the month when it goes live. It's basically a blockchain-based network where in a few clicks people with consumer to enterprise grade hardware can instantly lend out their GPU compute power and get paid in the token. Al companies can use the network at prices much more competitive than centralised solutiohs. The L1 and main net are launching by the end of this quarter. If the team delivers (their testnet functions flawlessly and is actually being used by some web3 Al Agent companies to train their bots already) I see this going 500mil+ in 2025. How much higher depends on whether the team is smart enough to get it there. It's theoretically an Akash/Bittensor killer. 


From the team: 

Overview:
At OpenGPU we've built a decentralized GPU Computing network that acts like a Bitcoin block validator. Individuals send their requests to a pool and GPU Providers compete with each other (based on factors such as GPU power and economical advantage) to be the one that executes these tasks.
Particularly AI Projects facing the challenge of scalability via traditional systems can leverage the power of this limitlessly scalable system without the need to adapt any infrastructure. In brief, as an AI company you simply push your AI model via a docker container and the network handles the rest. We're creating a competitive, decentralised marketplace for provision of the resources needed to run projects in both the traditional and Web3 spaces.

Out of 17 predictions analyzed, 15 were wrong, 1 was partially correct, and only 1 was fully accurate. [Link to the video is **here**.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FId5Ji-Tw0E)

I don't want to waste anyone's time (+ ADHD here) so I'll get right into it. 

**METHODOLOGY**

I made a spreadsheet ([available here] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uglm1iXVYqLXjYGah6_co7agDBlXK4i7ZuMC6aZrHaE/edit?usp=sharing)) where I kept track of Ben's exact statements and predictions regarding Bitcoin (price and dominance), Ethereum, and altcoins. The idea behind it wasn't to publish this or make a video about it - it was to use it for my own sanity, because I felt many of his predictions fell short, but could never point my finger as to why. I focused on predictions made in 2023 for fair evaluation, since some need months/years to play out. Then, I methodically checked each prediction against actual market performance and noted if it panned out or not. I made a video about it because, honestly, it's easier and faster to follow than clicking on each link in the spreadsheet. I'm not a youtuber, I don't need your subs, and this is the only video I'll ever publish. I just want to inform you.

**CONCLUSIONS**

Out of 17 statements that I followed up on, 15 ended up not panning out. 1 was partially correct, and another one was fully correct. Ben's predictions missed on the timing component, the value component, or both (in most cases). I won't go into specific statements - you have either the spreadsheet or the video to take a look at.

**TAKEAWAY**

In the end, this isn't about Ben at all. It's about EVERY YouTube and X crypto personality you follow. Here's the critical advice:

* Document EXACT statements - when an influencer makes a prediction, write down the EXACT words, including specific price targets, time frames, and conditions.

* Beware of narrative shifting - many influencers have a habit of slowly tweaking their narrative. They'll subtly modify their original statement over time so that when something eventually happens, they can claim they ""predicted"" it.

* Time and value matter - a prediction isn't just about being right eventually. The specific time frame and exact value are crucial. If someone predicts Bitcoin will hit $100k ""sometime in the future"", that's not a real prediction.

Start a spreadsheet. Track the precise claims. Compare them to actual market performance. You'll be shocked how often ""expert"" predictions fall apart under scrutiny.

Bottom Line: Do your own research. Be critical. Don't worship any single crypto influencer, no matter how popular they are."

This is not an Anti crypto or Bitcoin post. But this is a post regarding the complexity of bitcoin and storage for the average or novice crypto holder/trader. Will how Bitcoin is stored and or traded ever become easier so that the mainstream average person or older people can buy/trade/hold bitcoin. Now when you read this. You are coming from an advanced or better understanding of crypto than me or the average person. I have bought and or held crypto since 2016ish. I know little about cold wallets and I am just now setting up a trezor for my kids so that I can pass on btc to them for part of their inheritance. I believe like most of you that the value will increase. That's not the point of this discussion. What needs to happen or will happen so Bitcoin is more adaptable or usable for the average person. Ask any of your friends and I bet 50% or higher don't have a clue about what blockchain even is. Then ask them about cold storage for their crypto. If Bitcoin is going to become mainstream and become a larger token used for currency, it will have to become easier for the public to grasp and not get frustrated and give up trying to understand the complexity of what crypto/bitcoin is and how to store it safely so it can't be hacked.

You reading this and being familiar with how everything I have mentioned works, this might seem like a stretch. But if your grandparents or Joe blow is going to use crypto. It will have to become much easier to grasp and store it safely. Just setting up my wallet there is seed phrases, 12-24 word passwords, hidden wallets, default wallets, seed words I need to store and keep private to access my wallet and acct. not a chance 50% of the elderly can safely invest a decent part of their retirement in crypto and store it safely without a lot of help and at best they will be confused about the set up and not follow through. The more people involved in crypto, the quicker it becomes mainstream and prices grow even higher. Just a quick glance on the internet and billions of crypto is still being hacked and stolen each year. 

This is concerning to someone who is moving $6-7 figures in crypto to store in a wallet or cold storage. I lost $13k in 2020 or so by having random coins I had to sell then convert to this token from that token to cash out in cash. I sent coins from a wrong coin to another coin address and I was SOL. Lost that money and even hired a crypto attorney to see if they could recover my funds. Apparently once it went into that coin or wallet by my own doing and accident, There was no recovering them. 

Again that's not part of this discussion but the complexity of some trading could result is large losses. The average retiree won't be willing to put 1/3 or 1/2 their retirement into a coin or system that they will need training and help setting up a wallet to store their funds. My long winded post comes to the question. What can or will have to happen for btc to become mainstream enough the average or novice investor feels safe enough to be able to buy in and place part of their retirement in crypto. 


Setting up phrases then passworkd phrases to get in your trezor that can't be stored online for fear of hacking will scare your average investor. You reading this think this is foreign thinking because you have a basic or even advance understanding of crypto buying, sending and storing. Even now as I am setting up a tree safe 5, I am a little concerned about what I can do online in regards to being connected to the internet and what can and can't be hacked. So I store my words for my acct and trezor in a safe. How do you safely store your words and info in the case you pass away and need to transfer your assets to your kids. I don't think you want to store the words or passwords to your accts in your trust or will, people have access to that. I know there are stampings and metal plates you can store your passwords on but who and where do you trust to keep those. 

Your average 60-80 year old who is retired or close to retiring won't feel safe putting 6-7 figures in a system that is this complex to learn for a novice. I buy stocks , I pass away, my kids inherit my accts and they can keep or liquidate the stocks for liquid. I pass away and give them a cold storage wallet with the passwords and how to access the btc, that's a burden they now have to learn. Will crypto always be so complicated for those who don't spend time learning all the ins-outs of security. Buying Microsoft or Apple stock is simple enough. 

I can go to cashapp and buy stocks . I've been investing in stocks and various assets for 35 years, I've never been so worried about am I doing this and that right not to lose or have my btc hacked. Will the system ever become easy and mainstream enough that a lot of this fear is removed. I know debit cards are stolen and checking accts hacked, money moved. But your average person isn't near as worried about that as they are losing their crypto. I read between 6-17% of adults own crypto, that number needs to skyrocket to become mainstream. 

Look at the prices now, think of 50-60-80% of adults who own crypto, what that would do to the price. For crypto to become a mainstream form of currency. A lot of this fear and difficulty needs to be removed. Some of you reading this since you understand this will think this post is over the top. I assure you if you ask 50 people most of them have 2 concerns. How to buy and send and how to store it safely. Until that fear eases. Will crypto ever reach the price predictions some say if the average person can't buy, trade and store crypto without these worries. Again I own crypto. Will buy crypto, will store it to pass to my kids one day. But I feel the complexity of how to do this reamains one of the sticking points to what needs to become easier so the price reaches insane highs while removing the doubt of will I lose my crypto. 

Any thoughts if or how crypto becomes easier for the average Joe or retiree to buy and store becomes easier. Sorry for the long winded post but I hope you get the jist of the post.

Edit to post****+
Just to add to the complexity. I just ordered a tezor safe 5 and I had to cancel the order. I don't own a computer, only an iPhone and iPad. I trade 7 figures worth of stocks and options a week off an iPad but can't run a cold wallet from an iPad. This has to become easier and more mainstream . I can log in my bank acct with my iPad. Transfer or wire 6 figures to my investing acct. trade stocks. Sell stocks, wire the money back to my bank acct. buy bitcoin on cashapp and coinbase on my iPad but not use it for cold storage. Head scratching."
Bitcoin,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1h36wnm/while_everyone_focuses_on_saylor_and_el_salvador/,1h36wnm,"While everyone focuses on Saylor and El Salvador, the number 1 Bitcoin degen is actually Bhutan",2024-11-30 06:54:44.000000,"Here are some facts and statistics about Bhutan I pulled out:

*  Bhutan holds 1/3 of its entire GDP in Bitcoin, 13k Bitcoins in total
* The 13k Bitcoins is more than 2x El Salvador's holdings, and El Salvador has over 6 million citizens compared to 750k for Bhutan. So ""BTC holdings per capita"" is close to 20x for Bhutan compared to El Salvador
* Bhutan started getting into the crypto space in 2019, with BTC mining. This is before the hype phase in 2021.
* They mine BTC through hydroelectric power (clean energy). Once again ahead of the game and they don't need to spend millions of money/stonks like SaylorMoon or El Salvador. End 2021, they quietly started construction on the largest ever mining site while the buzz was around El Salvador buying BTC.
* So basically they are using BTC as a true ""revenue stream"" where a large part of their holdings are truly in BTC. You can think of Bhutan as your typical crypto degen, but instead as a crypto bro it is a country version of it.

Why do y'all think despite all these great use cases and being the first country ever to truly hold an enormous % of their GDP in Bitcoin, Bhutan does not have the attention?

They had XRP sitting in a Lobster wallet until they decided to convert it to XLM and transfer it over to a “QFS Ledger” wallet. After realizing it was a scam, they converted the XLM to Bitcoin, then tried to transfer the BTC to their cashapp. The BTC
never showed up, and of course there’s no transaction history in the QFS Ledger “wallet” (obviously, because it was fake). 

I began chatting with someone on X who was giving off pretty legit vibes, and I even began the process of “recovering” the stolen crypto (in quotes because i’m well aware that could have been a scam also) with them, but had to stop the process when transferring $20 over to a Trust crypto wallet turned into them wanting me to send $350. At that point, scam or not, it wasn’t worth the money. 

But as I see XRP on the up, I continue to wonder, is there a way stolen crypto can be genuinely recovered?  Are there people out there that actually can? If there’s authenticity to this, I’m willing to pay. I understand good work isn’t free, but I wasn’t willing to put myself, or family member, in a financially vulnerable position, or even a position where our info could be compromised, over a few hundred bucks. Just not worth it, but I still do ponder if there’s a solution.
Any advice is appreciated, apologies for a rant being my first post on this sub.
Happy late turkey day

TL;DR
Family member transferred crypto to fradulent wallet. I was contact with someone who claimed to know how to recover, but became wary after being asked to transfer money to a wallet they had sent me the passphrase to set up."

Doesnt mean I know anything.

It is my belief that at some point, just like every other market, there will be a bust/selection period where 99% of projects become worthless. Of the remaining survivors, maybe 5-6 take up 80-85% of the market share, 5-6 take up 5-10% and the remaining hundreds or thousands of coins make up the last 5-10%

Example: Theres Verizon, Att, T mobile at the top, then theres tracfone and boost and mint mobile, then theres 100 that nobody knows anything about. There are 100s of brands of batteries but very few companies who actually make the batteries. Tons of tv companies, 5-6 that people know, dozens that we dont, 100s of other ones, and only a handful of huge manufacturers that make everyones tvs at the same place.

This is what will happen IMO because it always does, since forever.

And while I dont really care if youre a fan of the US or not, the US is the strongest economy in the world, and it is in the best position to harness this and benefit from it and control the direction of the space in the US and global narrative. Im not saying this is the best for crypto or the world, but I think it's ignorant to outright say it wont matter.

With the US and other countries getting on board with a strategic reserve, its clear bitcoin is and will continue to be a winner for the foreseeable future.

I believe this is also why we have the Dino/US coins pumping as their leaders have recently all been meeting together with some of them like Hoskinson even getting involved directly with legislators, meeting with senators, getting in front of congress and talking about what is best for us. Founders have all recently met, are all ISO 20022 compliant, and are all going nuts. I think this is a winning recipe for this cycle and for the future and I just want people to be aware of it. These projects **XLM XRP ADA HBAR ALGO** are outperforming a lot of other coins and I believe this is why, despite people starting to call them all irrelevant before this happened.

I am saying this because this is my third cycle in the space and have wasted time and money looking for pumpy coins when if I had just kept my money where I had it 7 years ago in these Dino coins (in XRP and ADA anyways), id have been proven right in my early conviction of these projects. Look at the narrative, research it, and make an educated guess. Do not ignore these trends and its ok to take risks on meme coins with a little bit of your portfolio but make sure you are on the right side of history when it all shakes out, because it will at some point in the not so distant future."

Hey everyone!

I’m the founder of Sensible, a high yield account for your crypto. Crypto investors we’ve spoken to view crypto as a long-term investment, not a lottery ticket — but most crypto platforms are focused on getting you to trade every new token rather than getting the most out of your investment.

We made Sensible so that people who are holding the major cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin, Eth, and Sol — can put their crypto to work and earn a variable 2.5%-7.5% interest. We believe that everyday investors should have access to the same power of compounding interest that many of the more sophisticated investors are already using. Sensible works by enabling you to participate in staking (a blockchain-native way to earn interest while securing the network) via liquid staking tokens, which means you won’t have a lockup if you want to withdraw.

Sensible allows 24/7 withdraws, with no account fees or minimums. And unlike the other places that have offered yield on crypto over the years (we have that scar tissue, too), Sensible is *fully self-custody*, meaning that you remain in control of your crypto via your email address, and we could never access it even if we wanted to.

You can get started using Sensible at [holdsensible.com?vip=rcc](http://holdsensible.com?vip=rcc). Make an account via email (no SSN or credit card), and easily fund your account via a direct connection to Coinbase. As soon as you transfer, you start earning interest. Sensible takes 20% of the interest you earn, so we only make money if you do. Right now, we support ETH; with SOL and BTC coming soon.

Today, we’re giving people on r/cc invite-only access. You’re one of the first groups of people with access to Sensible, and you’re the only group allowed to invite friends — referrals will boost APY for yourself and your friend.

We’re sharing this here today and working with the r/cc mods because we’re hoping to get your thoughts and feedback while we continue to make Sensible better and more useful. We’ve worked closely with subreddits before — previously we built a marketplace for Reddit’s collectible avatars that did thousands of trades between redditors. We believe in building products for communities. Thanks for your time!"

If you project over a long period, with millions of transactions, this dust could represent substantial lost value and as Bitcoin's price continues to rise, this issue may worsen.

Any proposal on the table? Could some solutions include enabling dust consolidation via specialized wallets or adjusting transaction fees to make small amounts viable?

It seems important to help preserve value in an economy where every Satoshi matters, or are there better alternatives to address this issue? I know some centralized exchanges addressed this issue, but as a whole?"

""the official list of stupid crypto talking points"".

im not gonna go into detail about all the talking points, but in one of the points, it says that bitcoin ISN'T actually de-centralized.

as quoted:  
  
""The “hard cap” of 21M for BTC can easily be changed by altering a parameter in the source code. Less than 6 people have commit access to the repo so BTC’s source code control is centralized. It’s entirely possible if BTC existed long enough to the point where block rewards weren’t enough to motivate miners, and transaction fees became incredibly high, that influential players in the community would advocate increasing the cap and reinstating higher block rewards. So there are absolutely situations where the max amount in circulation could be increased.

is this true? cause honestly ive been thinking about this as well but kinda the other way around. could satoshi technically ""pull the plug"" on bitcoin and the whole thing just shuts down?"

Im very confused,2024-11-28 16:03:20.000000,"So first off Id like to say that I have no idea about Crypto. I just recently finished school, Im 19 years old. There is a man that offered to help my mom with some personal problems etc but then one day he told me he has a great offer for me. He is a wealthy businessman, he has Bitcoin and stuff so probably a millionaire. Well he told me about this Italian/Swiss company called SanusLife that is all about ecological stuff and everything. Well you used to get Sanuscredits when you bought some of their products (Water ionizers) which you can turn into SanusCoins. They are on the bitcoin Blockchain, the company is about 15 years old now.

They have an App called Sanuspay 3.0 and stuff, 1 SAC is worth 1.17 USD today. There are a maximum of 777.777.777 SAC available btw. So their aim is for you to be able to pay with the coin in various stores with the SanusPay function that is slowly rolling out and stuff. It does look kinda serious, Ive been to online meetings with a lot of people and everything. Oh and btw you need to pay 3.5 Dollars fee to create your account, apparently for some kind of administration fee for NAOCOIN some internet company. Oh and this is a MLM where you get 1000 free Sanuscredits for inviting people with your link to register and stuff, those 1000 get turned into about 6 SAC 

Its just that this man has been kind off Too nice to me for a stranger?? He keeps yapping about life and how family is important and stuff, and how I could help the SanusLife brand get more popular in Serbia and how this is a once in a lifetime offer and why wouldnt he help me, young people deserve a chance and now Im part of the Team Alpha... basically repeating the same stuff everytime he calls me on WhatsApp or Telegram (The usage of WhatsApp and Telegram also makes it kinda shady? Or is that just me)

So yesterday he called me saying how I should make 2 payments, one for 30 Dollars and one for 40 so I can get much more opportunities and cashback and whatnot (apparently some cashback of 30%?) and on top of that I should deposit 500 Dollars for some kind of voucher and get a return of 3x that much in the first month of SanusPay launch, and I should do it either today or tomorrow.

So me being me, a confused 19 year old, I dont know if this could become the next best thing or if its just another MLM scam or Ponzi scheme. You cant exchange the SAC to USD at the moment which also worries me. And the way how the man wants me to extend the marketplace to serbia and telling me not to stress cuz we will do everything step by step and I will be doing this for years... It kinda makes me want to block him and dip. I always panic when thinking about having to deal with anything for multiple years.

Does anyone have any advice what I could do here? Anyone ever heard of SanusLife? They dont have a rich online presence, just their own website and App and thats pretty much it. But inside the Telegram and whatsapp groups and Zoom Meetings it looks pretty serious.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

The urge to sell and cut your losses can be overwhelming. However, panic selling is one of the worst things you can do when it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin so for that fact we will use $BTC as today’s sentimental point in this context.

Here's why you should avoid panic selling Bitcoin:

1. Bitcoin is Volatile by Nature: The cryptocurrency market is known for its high volatility. Prices can fluctuate dramatically, both up and down, in a short period of time. Selling during a dip means you're likely to miss out on the inevitable rebound.

2. Bitcoin Tends to Recover: History has shown that Bitcoin has always recovered from its dips, often reaching new all-time highs. If you had sold your Bitcoin during previous market crashes, you would have missed out on massive gains.

3. Timing the Market is Extremely Difficult: It's nearly impossible to perfectly time the market and predict when the next dip or surge will happen. Trying to do so often leads to making emotional decisions that end up costing you.

4. Zoom Out and See the Bigger Picture: If you've been holding Bitcoin for a while, chances are you're still sitting on significant gains. Don't let a temporary dip erase all the hard-earned profits you've made. Take a step back and look at the long-term trend. 

The key is to remain patient and level-headed. Give it 12-24 hours before making any decisions. Often, a good night's sleep and a fresh perspective can make all the difference. Remember, Bitcoin's price history has shown that it always bounces back stronger than before.

So, rather than panic selling, consider this temporary dip as an opportunity to buy more Bitcoin at a discounted price. Stick to your investment strategy, and let time work in your favor.

Bitcoin,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1h1ezrm/am_i_understanding_this_right_crypto_world_is/,1h1ezrm,"Am I understanding this right, crypto world is essentially recreating the economy using blockchain?",2024-11-27 21:07:59.000000,"Im working to get my head around the crypto world. Heres what Ive gathered so far. Am I on the right track or not?

1. Bitcoin is just like any other fiat currency, except it is decentralized due to the invention of blockchain technology. Meaning, instead of having the government and banks keep track of who has what money, it allows individuals (and their computers) all over the world to keep track of who has what money. This is better because power is less concentrated.
2. Many additional crypto currencies have been created that do the same thing as Bitcoin, but each in their own unique methodology (protocol). As speculation rises and falls regarding the adoption of these currencies, their prices rise and fall as well. The ultimate goal when buying a coin is that it becomes a currency that has large market share in the blockchain world.
3. Crypto investors like the idea of decentralization so they have spread it to other business ideas. One of the main growth industries in crypto is lending. Crypto lenders use very similar methodologies to traditional fractional reserve banking such as collateralization, minimum reserves, and margin calls. However, there is almost no government regulation for these requirements. Crypto business operators and investors prefer this due to the freedom it creates.
4. As a way to raise capital for these business ideas, business owners issue governance tokens. These tokens have voting rights over the crypto project, which allows them to influence the way the business operates. And  gives them access to potential profits, if governance token holders vote to distribute those profits. There is no formal requirement for financial reporting or 3rd party audits because all transactions are viewable on the blockchain.
5. Additionally, these projects need a way to have financial stability, but they dont want to use fiat currency. So they often issue stable coins pegged to the USD. This can be a source of profit for the issuer but not for the stablecoin holder since the value is always around $1.

Is this correct? What else do I need to know? Thanks"
Bitcoin,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1h1drrj/i_asked_chatgpt_what_the_best_strategy_is_for/,1h1drrj,I asked ChatGPT what the best strategy is for investing in Cryptocurrencies. This is the response.,2024-11-27 20:15:01.000000,"Investing in cryptocurrencies can be lucrative but comes with significant risks due to their high volatility and unpredictable nature. Here’s a general strategy for investing responsibly and aiming for the best return on investment (ROI):

1. Do Your Research (DYOR)

	•	Understand the Market: Learn how cryptocurrencies work, including blockchain technology, market trends, and economic factors affecting prices.
	•	Study Projects: Focus on cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals—real-world use cases, active development teams, and transparent roadmaps.
	•	Analyze Risk Levels: Recognize the difference between established coins (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) and high-risk altcoins or meme coins.

2. Diversify Your Portfolio

	•	Balance Risk: Allocate funds across various coins to reduce risk. For example:
	•	Blue-Chip Cryptos: Bitcoin, Ethereum—low risk, steady growth potential.
	•	Altcoins: Polkadot, Solana, or other emerging platforms—higher risk, higher potential ROI.
	•	Speculative Tokens: Only a small portion of your investment—extremely high risk.
	•	Avoid putting all your money into a single cryptocurrency.

3. Use Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

	•	Invest a fixed amount regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly) instead of trying to time the market.
	•	Reduces the impact of volatility and helps you accumulate assets over time.

4. Focus on Long-Term Holding

	•	HODLing: Hold onto high-potential assets for several years to benefit from long-term growth rather than chasing short-term gains.
	•	Historically, coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum have rewarded long-term holders despite market crashes.

5. Stay Updated

	•	Monitor News and Trends: Stay informed about regulations, technological updates, and global economic events that affect crypto prices.
	•	Use tools like CoinMarketCap, Crypto Twitter, or Reddit to follow market updates.

6. Mitigate Risks

	•	Set Stop-Loss Orders: Automatically sell your holdings to limit losses during a crash.
	•	Avoid Emotional Decisions: Base trades on analysis rather than fear or greed.
	•	Secure Your Assets: Use hardware wallets to protect against hacking.

7. Staking and Yield Farming

	•	Stake your cryptocurrencies on blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, Solana) to earn passive income.
	•	Use DeFi platforms for yield farming but research them thoroughly to avoid scams.

8. Plan Your Exit Strategy

	•	Decide in advance when to take profits—e.g., after a specific price gain or ROI milestone.
	•	Reinvest gains or diversify into other asset classes like stocks or real estate.

What Typically Yields the Best ROI?

	•	Long-Term Investments in Blue-Chip Coins: Historically, Bitcoin and Ethereum provide steady growth over time.
	•	High-Risk Altcoins: Investing in promising altcoins early (e.g., Solana, Avalanche) can yield exponential returns but carries higher risks.
	•	Staking/Passive Income: Staking or participating in liquidity pools generates steady returns, enhancing ROI.

Final Advice

	•	Only invest what you can afford to lose.
	•	Avoid “FOMO” (Fear of Missing Out) during market hype.
	•	Regularly reevaluate your portfolio and adapt to market changes.

In the months after the first halving in 2012, the network hash rate and difficulty declined as less profitable miners turned off machines to reduce costs. However, by early 2013, Bitcoin kicked off its first major bull run, surging from $13 to ~ $1,000 by year's end.
The fears of miner capitulations were proven largely unfounded. The network hummed along, and the Bitcoin community learned an early lesson: Halvings are bullish for the Bitcoin network and the price of Bitcoin.

Some more text to keep the bot happy.

The first Bitcoin halving sliced off the first 50% of the Bitcoin mining reward – from 50 to 25 Bitcoins per block. Back then, the impact of the halving was still not priced in. The community was watching anxiously, as the closing price on the halving day was $12.20.

2. **Better tech, better adoption**

3. **Regulations are becoming clearer**

4. **Crypto isn’t just speculation anymore**  
   DeFi, NFTs, gaming, the metaverse—these are actual use cases that are pulling in new users who don’t care about price speculation. This means a stronger and more sustainable market.  

5. **halving effect **

Bitcoin,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1h10dkq/maga_maha_and_the_cryptocurrency_frontier_could/,1h10dkq,"MAGA, MAHA, and the Cryptocurrency Frontier: Could America Lead the Digital Gold Rush?",2024-11-27 09:18:05.000000,"# MAGA, MAHA, and the Cryptocurrency Frontier: Could America Lead the Digital Gold Rush?

As the cryptocurrency world sails through turbulent seas of innovation, regulation, and mass adoption, a surprising new force may soon chart its course: the MAGA and MAHA communities. With Donald Trump’s potential initiatives to establish America as the crypto capital of the world, the intersection of these movements and the crypto community could signal a transformative era for digital assets. Here’s why this potential alliance matters—and what it could mean for the future of finance.

# Understanding MAGA and MAHA in the Context of Crypto

**MAGA**: Rooted in principles of economic strength and American exceptionalism, MAGA promotes policies aimed at revitalizing American industries and fostering technological leadership. The crypto industry—an innovative and rapidly growing sector—aligns with MAGA’s vision of reclaiming global dominance in cutting-edge markets.

**MAHA**: Focused on health and sustainability, MAHA encourages policies that prioritize long-term prosperity and the well-being of communities. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have faced criticism for their environmental impact, could find synergy with MAHA’s goals by embracing greener blockchain technologies and promoting financial inclusion.

# Donald Trump’s Vision: America as the Crypto Capital

Donald Trump has historically expressed skepticism about cryptocurrency but has also demonstrated a penchant for bold, transformative strategies. If he aims to make America the crypto capital of the world, several key initiatives could come into play:

1. **Pro-Crypto Regulations**: Streamlined, business-friendly regulations could make the U.S. a haven for blockchain innovation, attracting companies and developers.
2. **National Blockchain Adoption**: By integrating blockchain into federal operations (e.g., voting systems, healthcare, and supply chains), America could set a global standard.
3. **Financial Sovereignty**: Trump’s platform could emphasize crypto as a tool for bypassing reliance on foreign banking systems and strengthening the dollar’s global influence.

# How MAGA and MAHA Could Reshape the Crypto Landscape

**1. Mass Adoption Through Political Mobilization**  
The MAGA and MAHA communities represent millions of Americans who may not yet be deeply engaged with cryptocurrency. A political push could bring these groups into the fold, leveraging their economic and ideological commitment to drive mass adoption of crypto as a national priority.

**2. Green Blockchain Initiatives**  
MAHA’s emphasis on health and sustainability aligns with the growing trend toward eco-friendly cryptocurrencies. Policies promoting proof-of-stake networks (e.g., Ethereum 2.0) or incentivizing renewable energy use in crypto mining could merge these goals.

**3. Infrastructure Investment**  
A MAGA-driven push for American industrial revitalization could lead to significant investments in blockchain infrastructure—creating jobs, fostering innovation, and ensuring the U.S. remains competitive in the digital economy.

**4. Crypto and Healthcare Synergy**  
MAHA’s focus on health could integrate blockchain technology into healthcare systems, enabling secure data sharing, reducing fraud, and improving efficiency. Crypto incentives could even be tied to wellness initiatives, promoting healthier lifestyles.

# Challenges and Opportunities

While this potential alignment offers immense promise, it also comes with challenges:

* **Regulatory Clarity**: Balancing innovation with consumer protection remains a delicate task.
* **Environmental Concerns**: Aligning crypto with MAHA’s sustainability goals will require ongoing technological advancements.
* **Political Polarization**: The ideological divide surrounding crypto and Trump’s leadership could hinder bipartisan support.

Opportunities, however, abound:

* **Crypto Education**: MAGA and MAHA could spearhead initiatives to educate the public on blockchain technology, fostering broader understanding and adoption.
* **Global Leadership**: A unified crypto strategy could position America as a beacon for innovation, attracting global talent and investments.

# The Future of Crypto in Trump’s America

If Trump and his MAGA/MAHA allies champion cryptocurrency, the ripple effects could be profound:

* **Accelerated Adoption**: Millions of new users could join the crypto ecosystem.
* **Policy Innovation**: Pro-crypto legislation could set the stage for a blockchain-driven economy.
* **Cultural Shift**: Cryptocurrencies could move from niche to mainstream, woven into the fabric of American economic identity.

# Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto?

The merger of MAGA, MAHA, and the cryptocurrency community could herald a new chapter in the digital revolution. With Trump’s leadership emphasizing innovation and national strength, America could emerge as a global leader in crypto—fueling economic growth, technological advancement, and financial sovereignty.

Having tried as hard as possible to read up on this and getting no conclusive answer, I have what I think to be a straightforward question still open. I've just read a reddit post about someone sending LiteCoin to a Bitcoin address by mistake, and all the comments were along the lines of ""it's gone forever"". 

How is it possible that a Bitcoin address passes the validation when sending LiteCoin and this transaction was accepted by the network? Given that a typo would most likely result in a rejection since some sort of checksum would fail, how is it even possible for a whole other cryptocurrency address to pass? 

Surely this is a known weakness and when new currencies are created their protocol for addresses is designed not to clash with other currencies? 

It just seems daft that we have this ultra complex decentralised system that's otherwise a cryptographic marvel, yet one could just lose all their money into the digital abyss which could be seemingly easily avoided by design? "

3. Is the technology sound? I believe it uses Ether's blockchain. Thats good right? Will this WLFI coin be unusually susceptible to theft? 

4. Right now they sell for $.015 per coin on the WLFI website. Do we have any idea of the current market value? Is there a secondary market anywhere? 

5. Could this one day be a real coin? Obviously Trump likes things with his name on them and will soon have lots of power. Might he eventually make this thing legit?

But putting it all into one stablecoin also seems quite risky. We have already seen UST collapse, and Tether is also constantly suspicious.

As I am native to Cardano ecosystem, I would try putting a little bit to every stablecoin in that ecosystem, but so far Cardano doesn't have the greatest stablecoin liquidity. I might put like 10%-20% put some into DJED and USDM, and 10-20% into BTC. But that would still me with a lot of rest to put into some other stablecoins like USDC etc.

2. **Ethereum (ETH):** ""Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake to save the planet, but let's be real: the only thing it's saving is developers from paying insane gas fees.""



3. **Tether (USDT):** ""Tether's pegged to the dollar, but with all that reserve drama, calling it 'stable' feels like telling a toddler they’re grounded.""



4. **Binance Coin (BNB):** ""Binance Coin is proof that being a jack of all trades in crypto just means you're first in line when regulators start handing out subpoenas.""



5. **Solana (SOL):** ""Solana's so fast, even its network outages can't keep up.""



6. **USD Coin (USDC):** ""USDC prides itself on transparency, which is ironic when it's the go-to for people hiding assets in plain sight.""

Bonus for Alt season:

Why is crypto alt season like a karaoke night?

Because everyone thinks they’re hitting the high notes, but most are just embarrassing themselves in the en,d!"
Tether,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1gx6628/now_the_market_is_back_hitting_alltime_highs_what/,1gx6628,Now the market is back hitting all-time highs... what do you see as the short-term risks? ,2024-11-22 11:58:37.000000,"When the market is going vertical and the greed  barometer is almost at full, I think it's more important than ever  to play devil's advocate. I feel there's always a notion from cynics that somehow everyone in crypto is blind to potential risks and pitfalls. Many suggesting that someday everything will implode and go to zero. Bitcoin is coming up for its 16th birthday and Ethereum it's 10th, they've already surpassed the expectations of doomsayers many times. 

The road to mainstream crypto adoption has never been simple or a straight-line. Around every corner lurks a China ban, Mt Gox/ FTX collapse, there is always something to test those diamond hands and balls of steel. The disruption of any market never been simple and hurdles should always be expected. 

So what do you see as the potential short-term risks?

For me it's potentially an investigation into Tether, that Donald Trump doesn't follow through on his promises or worse there's another assassination with a different outcome, or the fact that Coinbase continues to be so central especially as a disproportionate custodian for major corps/ ETFs, or that MicroStrategy goes so hard the wheels come off somewhere along the line. Again these are just potential risks I see, not that I'm saying they will happen just that they could be a  short-term risk in someway. It would be good to know what others think in the hope it helps to somehow alleviate them in the future particularly if the US does become crypto friendly I think it could be a real force to eliminate them early and make crypto stronger more quickly in the long term. Iron these things out and everyone could really benefit. 


**TLDR**

Many Crypto cynics often think those in crypto don't see/ accept risk. I believe most do, it's just we don't think it will end all crypto forever. Playing devil's advocate, what do you see as potential short-term risks now the market is hitting all-time highs?"

Edit:
I tried to post this but apparently a post has to have a minimum count of letters to be interesting or helpful so please forgive me for filling this post up with additional useless words so I can comply with the rules.

I will just add some parts of the article for you as a teaser:

""Tether’s claims of being backed 1:1 are provably false:
Adding to the concern for the legitimacy of Tether, is that they have also previously claimed all the way up until 2018 that their reserves were subject to frequent professional audits. This is patently false. There had not been a single independent audit conducted on Tether’s reserves up until 2020, which was conducted by a less than legitimate agency housed in the Cayman Islands.""


""Now , because Tether is completely controlled by the same guys that run a massive crypto exchange it essentially means that this crew of questionable characters (which we’ll read more about in a second) can create new Tethers (which are always worth a dollar) out of thin air and funnel them directly onto their exchange, without any scrutiny or regulation from a third party.

They can then use said Tethers (worth US$1 each despite being oftentimes unbacked) to buy real cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. After purchasing actual cryptocurrency  —   they can use new holdings of real crypto to mint even more new Tethers. This creates an enormous amount of real cash out of absolutely nowhere.

In plain English ,  by controlling the supply of Tether, this gang of anti-Robin Hoods basically gained access to their own personal money printer. They can indefinitely print money and then use that fake money to buy real cryptocurrency. They then sell this cryptocurrency and use that money to back more of their Tethers…

Beginning to see how this could death spiral?

Republicans aren't the crypto boosters everyone makes them out to be, and the way Trump has used crypto as a grift to make money just reinforces existing stereotypes about crypto being scammy.

I know, I know. We're all saturated with politics and election crap right now and we're tired of it. Me too. But I hear the idea that ""Republicans are the pro-crypto party"" all the time and it's just not true.

https://preview.redd.it/e9aor4poqyyd1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9d39dea07e453748665ef5d8328094120fbb031

First, Republicans aren't uniformly supportive of crypto and Democrats aren't uniformly against it. My no-talent ass clown of a Senator (Roger Marshall) is a hardcore MAGA Republican but wildly anti-crypto. He called crypto a [""threat to our national security""](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-marshall-cryptocurrency-is-a-threat-to-our-national-security/) and co-sponsored a bill with Elizabeth Warren to make stricter AML/KYC regulations. During the FTX debacle he even suggested that the SEC [shut down all crypto transactions in the US](https://www.semafor.com/article/12/02/2022/roger-marshall-kansas). Saying that Democrats aren't supportive of crypto isn't true either. When you look at the list of [congressional candidates endorsed by Stand With Crypto](https://www.standwithcrypto.org/races/endorsed), half of them (19/39) are Democrats. Not to mention that Democrats incorporated some crypto-supportive events into the [DNC convention](https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/09/24/how-democrats-have-shifted-on-crypto/) and [Anthony Scaramucci has reportedly been working with Kamala Harris](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/20/anthony-scaramucci-kamala-harris-campaigns-digital-asset-policies-.html) to develop pro-crypto policies. Saying Republicans are the more crypto-supportive party may have been true 5 years ago, but that has changed.

Secondly, we've got to talk about Trump. Saying that Trump is pro-crypto is like saying a bank robber is pro-unmarked bills. [His recent ""pro-crypto"" turn](https://www.axios.com/2024/05/30/trump-crypto-bitcoin-nfts) is at best a flip-flop and at worst a grift. In 2019 he said that [Bitcoin was ""based on thin air""](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192?lang=en) and as recently as [December of 2021](https://decrypt.co/89108/donald-trump-calls-crypto-dangerous-even-as-melania-launches-nft), he called crypto ""dangerous"" and a ""scam."" ([And he would know!](https://apnews.com/article/17e975d3ccba4a92a9b023dff8437b21)) But recently crypto has been very kind to him. [One of his wallets](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/donald-trump) has almost $6 million in it.

Not to be too much of a conspiracy theorist, but It ***really seems like*** after Melania Trump made an [unspecified (large) amount of money on a bunch of NFT projects in 2021 and 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2022/jan/04/melanias-latest-nft-is-selling-for-180000-at-last-one-of-the-trumps-is-showing-entrepreneurial-spirit), Donald [suddenly changed his tune on crypto and started issuing a bunch of NFTs](https://decrypt.co/249755/trump-credits-nfts-change-of-heart-bitcoin-crypto) himself. When the NFT market dried up, he pivoted and was [collecting 2% of every transaction on shitcoins called things like ""Trump Bucks"" and ""Save America""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-donald-trump-made-nft-213019678.html) netting him at least a half million dollars. And of course don't forget about his newest ~~scam~~ DeFi project World Liberty Financial, [where 75% of all protocol revenue goes to the Trump family](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1g69fob/trump_family_gets_75_of_crypto_coin_revenue_has/) (who also has no liability) and who [couldn't keep their own website running](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/15/trump-familys-world-liberty-finance-token-sale-appears-to-go-live-selling-220m-wlfi-in-minutes/) during the rollout even though there wasn't much interest in the project.

I'm sure it's clear how I feel about him, and if you want to vote for him, be my guest. But don't do it because you think he's ""pro-crypto"" and will pump your bags if he's elected.

https://preview.redd.it/sxtxfrmk8zyd1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=51868abee8cbcf201081e38fb3ce5761066636a1

It seems pretty clear that he has no idea what crypto is or how it works. He [can't work a crypto wallet well enough to buy a burger with it](https://youtube.com/shorts/HIv4cwkz16U?si=2zjUCdPTnYVN9l_q), tweeted that he'll make sure Bitcoin is ""[made in the USA](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1852033244729860397)"" and stumbled through a [recent interview](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/donald-trump-struggles-and-seems-confused-in-painful-crypto-interview-while-trying-to-change-topic/ar-AA1qGv5X), saying:

>""It's so important. It's crypto. It's AI. It's so many other things. AI needs tremendous electricity capabilities beyond anything I ever heard.""

At the very best, he doesn't give a shit and will forget about and ignore it once it stops making him money, which effectively gives other countries the ability to set crypto regulation and reinforces the stereotype that crypto is super scammy. This point has been made over and over, but if we want the industry to grow sustainably for the long-term, [we need clear, effective regulation](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/22/tether-ceo-ardoino-says-he-expects-us-will-catch-up-in-crypto-regulation/), not benign neglect.

***Full blog post with all the tables*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45)***.***

January 1st, 2021, I bought $100 of following and turned it into a homemade crypto index fund: **Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, XRP, Litecoin, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Binance Coin,** and **Chainlink.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 OCT Snapshot).**

***tl;dr:***

* **What's this all about?** Back in January 2018, I created a homemade crypto Index Fund, purchasing $100 of each of the Top 10. Crypto winter started immediately after, but I haven't sold or traded and have been reporting monthly ever since. I repeated the Experiment 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and again in 2024 because I'm a glutton for punishment (and to show different entry points).
* ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments (including why in the world I would include Tether)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **SEPTEMBER HIGHLIGHTS:** **LINK** and **ADA** turned in the strongest performances this month. **BNB** continues to maintain a strong overall lead, followed very distantly by **ETH**. 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +196% in forty-five months vs. the S&P500's +52%.
* **2018+2019+2020+2021+2022+2023+2024 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning +196% compared to +65% in the S&P 500 if invested as per the rules of the Experiments.**



# Month Forty-Five – UP 196%

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, Litecoin, DOT, BCH, ADA, BNB,** and **LINK**.  

September highlights for the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio: 

* **LINK** and **ADA** turned in the strongest performances this month
* **BNB** is still way out in front overall, followed very distantly by **ETH**.
* 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +196% in forty-five months

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2021:**  forty-five months into the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, five cryptos have dropped out: **Chainlink, Cardano, Litecoin, Polkadot** and **Bitcoin Cash.**

# September Winners and Losers

***September Winners*** – **LINK** (+17%) and **ADA** (+16%) performed the best in September

***September Losers*** – **LTC** turned in the worst performance, but still gained +7% this month.

# Overall Update – BNB dominates, ETH in distant second place, 70% of cryptos in green, DOT worst performing

As has been the case for most of the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, **BNB** remains the dominant crypto in the portfolio, by far.  It is up **+1399%**, the $100 investment into **BNB** forty-five months ago now worth **$1503.  ETH** is in distant second place, up +256% followed by **XRP** in third place and **BTC** in fourth place.

At the bottom, **DOT** is the worst performing of the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio cryptos at this point in the Experiment, down **-48%** since [January 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/). 

# Bitcoin Dominance:

**BitDom** has bounced a bit since the beginning of the year, now sitting at 55.8% and is generally on an uptrend since early 2023. 

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2021:

https://preview.redd.it/ryu9oce6naxd1.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6ce3c6a87b85501fdc3e01c0960bbb6cde69df7

Overall, the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +196%.  The initial $1000 investment forty-five months ago, on New Year’s Day, 2021, is worth **$2,962**.

As most readers are aware, this is the sixth year of an Experiment I started back in January of 2018, [at the height of a crypto bull run](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  Where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +2% (total value $1,021)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +440% (total value $5,401)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +697% (total value $7,967) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +196% (total value $2,962)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): down -44% (total value $558) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +71% (total value $1,714)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-9): up +8% (total value $1,080)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,703**

**That’s up +196%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

In summary: ***That’s a +196% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/yx1ad7kanaxd1.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a29e74e79830e5a489b6e87d36a7620103f4101

The S&P 500 Index is up **+52%** since January 1st, 2021.  The initial $1k investment I put into crypto forty-five months ago would be worth **$1,520** had it been redirected to the S&P 500.

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is up **+196%** over the same time period – the initial $1k investment in crypto forty-five months ago is now worth **$2,962.**

That’s a difference of **$1,442** on a $1k investment in forty-five months.

What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&P 500 the same way I did during the first seven years of the Top Top Crypto Index Fund Experiments? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,136 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,278 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,767 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,520 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,198 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,487 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,197 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,460.**

That is up **+65%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+196%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

To help provide perspective, here’s a chart showing the combined seven year ROI for the Crypto Top Ten Experiment vs. the S&P up to this point:

Tether,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1gcp2qw/bolivia_takes_a_bold_step_amid_an_economical/,1gcp2qw,"Bolivia Takes a Bold Step Amid an Economical Crisis: Pioneers Regulated Crypto Custody Service (USDT), Expanding Financial Options for Citizens",2024-10-26 16:35:36.000000,"In a move that promises to transform the Bolivian financial landscape, Banco Bisa has announced the implementation of an innovative custody service for virtual assets, specifically USDT, that allows clients to buy, sell and transfer cryptocurrencies safely and efficiently. Franco Urquidi, Vice President of Business at the financial institution, highlighted that all transactions must be made to and from an account at Banco Bisa, which guarantees a high level of security. 

This new service offers clients the possibility of holding funds in USDT for as long as they wish, making payments abroad and even sending money to relatives studying abroad. “The sky is the limit,” said Urquidi, referring to the future functionalities that the bank plans to offer in this area.

 USDT (Tether) is a cryptocurrency designed to maintain its value at parity with the US dollar. This makes it a “stablecoin” or stable currency, whose value is backed by dollar reserves. The idea is that each USDT in circulation is backed by a dollar in the accounts of Tether Limited, the company that issues this currency, which helps stabilize its price. 

The director of the Financial System Supervision Authority (ASFI), Yvette Espinoza, supported the initiative by pointing out that Banco Bisa is a pioneer in offering this service within a regulatory framework that guarantees the security and confidence of users. ""This is a custody service that will allow clients to carry out various operations safely, reducing the risk of unsafe interactions in the cryptocurrency market,"" said Espinoza.

The vice president of Banco Bisa also emphasized the importance of financial education in the use of virtual assets. To this end, the bank has established strategic alliances with recognized international custody and exchange companies, thus ensuring data protection and the prevention of illicit activities. ""Our clients go through a rigorous verification process, which gives them the peace of mind that their transactions are carried out through safe and reliable channels,"" added Urquidi.

 Furthermore, the cost of this service is affordable. USDT sales start at a minimum of 200 USDT up to a daily limit of 10,000, with fees ranging from 35 to 100 bolivianos, depending on the amount. Transfers to dollar accounts abroad cost Bs 280, representing an attractive option for those looking to use cryptocurrencies for international payments. 

With the recent authorization from ASFI for other financial entities to also offer services related to virtual assets, Banco Bisa is positioned as a leader in innovation in the Bolivian market. The entity is committed to training its users, ensuring that they understand both the benefits and risks associated with handling cryptocurrencies.

In short, Banco Bisa is not only ushering in a new era in the Bolivian financial sector, but is also setting a standard in security and financial education in the use of virtual assets. ""The future looks promising for those looking to explore the world of cryptocurrencies in Bolivia,"" Urquidi highlighted.

[ASFI \(Bolivian Financial Regulator\) director Yvette Espinoza was at the press conference giving her support to the financial institution and stressed that innovation in financial services should be developed in a coordinated manner with the regulator and the Government.](https://preview.redd.it/1surkhlho4xd1.jpg?width=760&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e6c8cb67b8240ac55f38ae92333dfa370010c46)

Tether,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1fyujss/as_a_prolofic_alt_investor_this_is_my_greatest/,1fyujss,"As a prolofic Alt Investor, This Is My Greatest Argument Against Alts.",2024-10-08 07:57:29.000000,"If you check my history, you’ll rarely find a post from me that’s entirely pro-BTC. So please don’t assume that this is one. Why am I saying this? Because I cannot make my point without referring to BTC. And, while this may come across as pro-BTC, my actual goal is to argue against alternative cryptocurrencies (alts). If my criticism of alts seems to favor BTC, it’s simply because the weaknesses of alts highlight the relative strengths of BTC. And I cannot make my argument without it.

Now, let’s get into it: Alternative cryptocurrencies are a poor investment as long as BTC and fiat currencies exist—especially BTC.

**Why?**

1. **Alts are tethered to BTC and fiat.** Most altcoins are heavily influenced by the price of BTC. If BTC rises, many alts follow, and if BTC falls, alts usually fall even harder. For example, during the 2022 crypto crash, BTC’s drop wiped out not just a lot of its own market value crashing to about $15,000 from almost $70,000 but altcoin market as well. Now you might say everything crashed. Yes. But ALTs dropped more than BTC did. BTC dropped by 70-75%ish. Alts? 95% or more. 

2. **Alts track BTC’s volatility.** If BTC takes a nosedive, altcoins typically experience an even steeper decline. This was evident in the 2018 bear market, where BTC dropped by 85%, but many alts, like Ethereum, lost over 90% of their value. Ethereum did nothing wrong. It is home to thousands of alts that still operate on it and the staging ground for many that moved to their own network later on. Yet, it suffered a crash not because it did anything wrong, but because it was pegged to BTC.

3. **Dumping for fiat can tank alts.** Let's say BTC crashes 10% causing a -10% in the price of your alt even if no one sells. Then when people start selling to fiat, it crashes further. 

4. **Many alts are centralized with a ""CEO.""** Do you remember when the founder of Litecoin, Charlie Lee, sold off his entire LTC holdings, the market reacted negatively, sending the price into freefall, even though the project itself hadn’t changed. It was trading at almost $400 USD....400. FOUR HUNDRED. Today? sub-70 USD.

So, why bother investing in alts? I’m not saying you should put your money into BTC either, but BTC doesn’t suffer from the same vulnerabilities that altcoins do. If you believe in the ecosystem and think that certain altcoins solve real-world problems, then sure, invest in any alt that you want. But if you care about the price... So, it literally feels like the success of most alts depends on BTC’s performance and the faith of holders not to sell. While BTC only depends on the faith in people not to sell.

It is like fighting a war on two fronts with alts. Actually, more like 2+ whatever else that the alt garners, from public opinion, liquidity, etc. 

------

**So, if you are going to respond, please answer this question:** Given the reasons I have given (and not given because I do not want to make this very long) on why alts suffer when it comes to price-action, why bother investing in alts at all?

* Note that, TRX SMA(50) price is below the SMA(200) price in the 4Hr candlestick interval. If the TRX completes the bullish crossover (SMA 50 above SMA 200), a strong new wave of TRX price upward trend will start.

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2020:**  after fifty-six months, half of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out:  **EOS**, **BSV, Tezos, Litecoin,** and **Bitcoin Cash** are gone.

At #86, **Tezos** has sunk the lowest since January 2020.

# August Winners and Losers 

***August Winners*** – None.  **XRP** and **Litecoin** fell the least, down -6% and -7% respectively**.**

***August Losers*** – **ETH** and **BCH** both fell -23% this month, each losing about a quarter of its value.

# Overall Update – BNB remains solidly in first place, followed by second place ETH. 70% of cryptos at break even or positive territory. 2020 Top Ten is the best performing Top Ten Portfolio.

At +617%, the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio continues to be the best performing of the seven [Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 70% of the 2020 cryptos are in positive or break-even territory. **EOS, Tezos,** and **BSV** are the lone exceptions.

**Binance Coin** continues to hold a significant lead, with **ETH** in a strong second place. **Bitcoin** is a distant third place.

The initial $100 investment fifty-six months ago into first place **Binance Coin**? Currently worth **$3,672**, an increase of +3,572%.    

In second place is **Ethereum,** up +1,793%.

**EOS** is by far the worst performer in the 2020 group, down -82% since January 2020.   

# Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/debqlzql0kpd1.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeaf370e9cba584a53ba46187bb6430253b9465f

As a sector, crypto is up **+959%** over the fifty-six month lifespan of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.

There was no easy way to do it at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since [January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) (+959%), you’d be doing quite a bit better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+617%) and ridiculously better than the S&P (+75%) over the same time period.  Much more on the S&P below. 

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**$185B in March 2020** **(aka Zombie Apocalypse).**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3) 

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:  [**$2.6T in October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-22).

# Bitcoin Dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/o0o6b84n0kpd1.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=01b5f6b3fc24a5fbe107ff0d244c3ed7df3c42b3

**BitDom** ended August at 56.3% and has seen a steady rise over the last few months.

Here are the high and low points of **BTC** domination since the beginning of the 2020 Experiment:

Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**38.1% in November 2022**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35).

High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.4% in December 2020**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-1-year-report/).

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/j9odjl3o0kpd1.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&s=354eba8350160590cf48a6883f2ae58655ae4be9

The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio is now worth **$7,172** (+617%) from the initial $1k investment.  

The 2020 Portfolio remains the best performing of [the seven Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 

Below is a month by month ROI of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective and provide an overview as we go along: 

https://preview.redd.it/o36jwlsp0kpd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=287a6e5790576f9572d886f5ec37c305c98f2874

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So what about combining seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): down -7% (total value $927)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +400% (total value $5,001)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +617% (total value $7,172) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +165% (total value $2,650)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): down -51% (total value $488) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +54% (total value $1,539)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-8): up -5% (total value $946)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$18,722**

**That’s up +167%** on the combined portfolio, the lowest level since [January 2024](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/). The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**. 

Lost in the numbers? Here’s a graph to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

https://preview.redd.it/n43iw1xr0kpd1.png?width=1188&format=png&auto=webp&s=8056b9e75e0683d43eb55bd4e1a79e60a58d1afd

In summary: ***That’s a +167% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/lczzs0mt0kpd1.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=12e9914e10f9520698ca81a54e833ef2e435a265

Since the S&P 500 has returned +75% since January 1st, 2020, that same [$1k I put into crypto](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) in January 2020 would be worth $1,750 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 instead. 

Crypto over the same time period? The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning **+617%**, worth **$7,172.**

**That’s a difference of $5,422 on a $1k investment.**

But that’s just 2020. What about other entry points? What if I invested in the S&P 500 the same way I did during the first seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018, what I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,110 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,250 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,750 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,500 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,190 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,470 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,180 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,460.**

That is up **+64%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+167%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

To help provide perspective, here’s a look at the combined seven year ROI for crypto vs. the S&P up to this point.

# Conclusion:

For those who have supported the Experiments over the years, thank you.  For those just getting into crypto, I hope these monthly reports can somehow help with perspective as you embark on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2024 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-8) reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  August’s extended report covers the one you’re reading here, the [2020 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56). You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78), [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39), [2022 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28), and [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17) reports as well."

This is despite the fact that 5 years after it launched it was still just a little over $4 billion. It's currently now sitting the third largest crypto by market cap in the world according to CMC, ranking ahead of every other crypto in the world by market cap apart from Ethereum and Bitcoin. 

Over the years many critics including those in the crypto community have suggested it's vastly manipulated.

From 2014 to 2017, Tether didn't publish reports on reserves however after 2022, Tether has published quarterly attestations. Attestation are different from an audit. An audit asks a firm to conduct an independent analysis of a business and its practices where with an attestation Tether provides the accounting firm with documentation and the scope of the accounting firm’s financial review. In addition Tether have also admitted that the big four audit firms won't touch them. 

All Tether needs to do is have a proper/ full financial audit by a major name to silence the cynics and critics... yet they can't do it. 

The question at what point will the majority of the crypto community finally lose patience with Tether, call it out and disown/ outcast it one and for all?"

July highlights for the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio: 

* **XRP** significantly outperforms its peers this month, **LTC** and **ETH** slip -8% each.

**Top Ten dropouts since July 2019:** After sixty-seven months, 60% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten in January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/)  have been knocked out.

**EOS** has fallen the furthest in rank so far (#76).

# July Winners and Losers 

***July Winners*** – **XRP** (+22%) easily outperformed the rest of the Top Ten followed by a +9% month for **Stellar**.

***July Losers*** – **ETH** and **LTC** both lost -9% in July making them the worst performers of the month.

# Overall Update: ETH far ahead of the pack followed by BTC. 70% of cryptos in positive territory, EOS in the basement.

**ETH** (+2,217% since Jan. 2019) continues to be the best performer of this group, by far.  In distant second place is  **BTC** (+1,609%) followed by third place **Tron** (+554%).

**The $100 investment into first place ETH on** [**January 1st, 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/) **is currently worth $2,378.**

After sixty-seven months, 70% of the cryptos in the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio are in positive territory. The worst performer is **EOS** (-79%)**.**

# Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

There was no easy way to do so at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire cryptocurrency market since [January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/), you would be up +1,707%

This is still behind first place **ETH** (+2,217%) but much better than the rest of the Top Ten cryptos, including second place **Bitcoin** (+1,609%).  

The total market is performing much better than the Top Ten approach (+470%) as well.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$114B in** [**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$2.65T in** [**October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34).

# Bitcoin Dominance:

**BitDom** ended the month at 55.3%.

For context, here are the high and low points of **BTC** domination over the life of the 2019 Experiment:

Low Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**38.1% in November 2022.**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46)

High Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-eight/).

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2019:

https://preview.redd.it/ft1jnw8mq7ld1.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba72afe6755902d8260dc8a2015983a235c48584

After sixty-seven months, the value of the initial $1000 investment is **$5**,**697** up +470%. This is down from [November 2021’s all time high](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35) of +665% for the 2019 Portfolio. 

Although the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio is up +470%, it is not the best performing of the seven Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment Portfolios: it is still a distant second place behind the [2020 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-50) which is up +736% at the moment.

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

Speaking of other Top Ten Portfolios, let’s put all seven together now:

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +12% (total value $1,102)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +470% (total value $5,697)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-50): up +736% (total value $8,357) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +203% (total value $3,033)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): down -43% (total value $570) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +77% (total value $1,775)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-7): up +10% (total value $1,102)

So overall? Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$21,637.** 

**That’s up +209%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/yhtp1fnpq7ld1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5cb5a57734bbb991de6cd3201ce72a39b7f85ae

In summary: ***That’s a +209% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the experiments to have a comparison point with traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/2t6qin0vq7ld1.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=a23e46a094531231b06b6877602bfc63b0e083dd

Because the S&P 500 Index is up 117% since January 2019, the initial $1k investment I put into crypto sixty-seven months ago would be worth $2,170 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 in January 2019. 

But what if I took the same world’s-slowest-dollar-cost-averaging $1,000-per-year-on-January-1st-Crypto-Index-Fund-Experiment approach with the S&P 500? It would yield the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,040 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,170 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,690 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,450 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,140 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,420 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,140 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,050.**

That is up **+58%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+209%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

Here’s a table providing an overview of the seven year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P:

# Conclusion:

To both old-timers and newcomers: thanks so much for taking the time to read and for supporting the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments. I hope you find the updates helpful in terms of perspective as you navigate the crypto landscape.  Be careful out there and don’t put your mental, physical, or financial health at risk chasing gainz. If crypto is causing you to lose sleep at night, chances are you have too much in crypto: try to think long term and don’t invest what you truly can’t afford to lose. Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for the latest progress reports. A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2024 Top Ten Portfolio report](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-7) + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  July’s extended report is the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio (the one you’re reading now).

This is something cryptocurrency Reddit can’t understand because the only metric that matters is number go up.** 

Is this the revolution we signed up for? To have \~10 companies come in and completely take over cryptocurrencies and basically run them and control them?

**Industry Overview**

Let's talk a little bit about where the industry as a whole is going and some of the existential concerns that mainstream cryptocurrency people fully appreciate or understand. It’s really a turning point in the industry.

**Algorithmic Stable Coins**

The algorithmic stable coins are an essential thing that we need to as an industry look into, and that asset-backed stable coins are a little problematic.

**Vol. and Txs**

Stables represent about 10% by value of the crypto market cap, of which USDT and the USDC are the overwhelming majority of those things. *But they dominate the on-chain transaction volume, about 70% of all transaction volume.* ***So from a crypto perspective, ETH and Bitcoin take a backseat to USDC and USDT.*** These are, by volume, the value transfer mechanisms of our industry. They represent the huge majority of on-chain traffic and value transfer in our industry.

  
***Stable Coins***

**Asset-Backed Stable Coins**

Now, there’s something about these two guys, USDT and USDC. **They are asset-backed, a very important term. Asset-backed means that there are two properties you can’t get away from.**

* **Central Issuer**: There’s a central issuer, a company who is regulated in a jurisdiction subject to that jurisdiction’s rules and regulations. Whatever that jurisdiction wants to put upon that company, permissive or otherwise, they aresubject to it. They’re a business like a bank or anything else responding to that regulation.
* **Fractional Issue**: They can’t go fractional. That’s a good thing, but with a hard fork, let’s say there’s Bitcoin splitting and there’s Bitcoin A or Bitcoin B, or more pertinent to this example, Ethereum splitting Ethereum A, Ethereum B. You can’t have a situation where the stable coin issuer says, “You know what, I’m going to let my stable coin be on both sides and we’ll just let it ride.” Why? Because doublingthe supply means that they’re only backed by 50 cents to the*dollar.* They have to pick a winner. They either pick A or they pick B, A or B, but not both. They can’t pick both by design. If 70% of all your transactions, all your value transfer is occurring at that stable coin level and your entire DeFi economy relies on that, you can’t be the chain that suddenly loses USDC or Tether. You have to be the other chain.
* **Stable Coin Split Scenario**: What if they split and one side decides to put KYC into the whole system and the stable coins support that split. The other side just lost your stable coin, meaning they lost all their liquidity and their DeFi backbone. This property forces them to pick a winner.
* **Power to the Stable Coin Issuer**: You have now implicitly given the stable coin issuer or the *asset-backed stable coin issuer that power. A small group of people you’ve never met, you have no relationship with, you didn’t elect them, they have nothing to do with your underlying asset, they have that power and authority now. That’s incumbent in the design.*

**Algorithmic Stable Coins**

**The only coin that is not subject to these issues are algorithmic stable coins because they take a crypto asset and make another crypto asset.** The algorithms, the custody, all these things are moderated on-chain. The only thing that’s value compatible with cryptocurrency is algorithmic stable coins, not asset-backed unless you have crypto assets backing other things and your blockchain is 	the custodian. Only an algorithmic coin has that property.

* Ownership **and Voting**: now you have some notion of ownership and of course, the users can vote chain A or chain B for that honoring. But an individual or corporation doesn’t get carte blanche to decide which side of the equation to be on.

**Reddit Reaction**

*The cryptocurrency Reddit think that all stable coins are suitable for the crypto industry. The vast majority of people care about the number going up. They don’t stop for a moment and understand the existential risk.* Is crypto eating Legacy or is Legacy eating crypto? This is something cryptocurrency Reddit can’t understand because the only metric that matters is number go up.

**Bitcoin ETFs**

* ***if you look at 10 billion for Bitcoin ETFs amongst Black Rock and these other Bitcoin trusts, that translates to 200,000 Bitcoin being in the hands of a small group of actors who are regulated. They have the exact same power as Circle now with Bitcoin.***
* **Forking Scenario**: If you fork and you have BTC chain A and BTCchain B and the ETFs say they support chain B, they take whatever assets they have that have just been replicated in chain A and they sell all of it. The price of chain A goes into freefall and the miners move over to B as hash power falls. The dominant chain becomes chain B as more of these legacy actors come in, they’ll acquire more and more of the supply. **They already have a fifth of what Satoshi has.**

**Centralized Exchanges**

* Looking at the centralized exchanges, they are happy because the number goes up. *The top three crypto exchanges control the vast majority of transactions and trade by dollar value.*
* **Power of ETF Holders and Central Exchanges**:A small group of ETF holders and central exchanges, along with two big asset-backed stable coins which constitute 70% of the value *transfers, control the vast majority of your value flow.*
* Legacy **Institutions**: ***Ten legacy regulated institutions also get to decide the future of all these projects. If you go in a different direction, they won’t list you, they won’t give you a stable coin, and they’ll dump your coin.***

**Industry Reflection**:

We as an industry need to take a step back, take a deep breath, and really ask ourselves why we are here, what’s the point of these things, and are we as an industry so prepared to hand away what makes the industry special, unique, and frankly sustainable to the very people that we were trying to get away from because number go up.

* **Decisions and Consequences**: *Every decision has consequences, positive and negative. Every single approach has trade-offs. Nothing is free in life and every single thing we do, we have to ask ourselves does this move us closer to a more egalitarian, a more fair and transparent world, or does this move us closer to the very people we started trying to run away from as an industry. Every time you hand your custody decision, your voice, your hash power, your voting power to a centralized entity, you are restoring an order that we were trying to usurp.*
* **Dependency on Actors**: Every time you create an actor upon whom you have a dependency, you remove the promise of Web3. This could be services of convenience like OpenSea, Infura, Alchemy, or being in an exchange to custody your coins and let them vote with it and stake with it.
* **Centralization Decision**: Embracing an asset-backed stable coin over an algorithmic one is **making a decision that it’s okay to be centralized**. This might be because you don’t care about cryptocurrency philosophy or any of the values and principles that this entire industry was formed upon.
* **Consequences**: The consequences are that these assets are now no different from the legacy assets we sought to replace. They’re just basically a different flavor. You’ve replaced the cane sugar with high fructose corn syrup, going in the opposite direction.
* **Speaking Out**: *There’s a need to speak out about these issues, especially where there’s none of the other prominent leaders coming forward and really expressing themselves. Little by little, they start doing business with these same firms and building relationships with these firms because they want to keep the fortunes that they’ve made.*
* **Concerns**: There are concerns that ten actors together get to decide right now the direction and fate of cryptocurrencies by how they upgrade, which ones are valuable, and which ones have liquidity.
* **Future Concerns**: *Over the arc of time,* ***the next five or ten years, we’re going to see stringent KYC and AML put on every wallet, a boatload of CBDCs entering our space and being treated like cryptocurrencies, everything moved towards a permission divination only system****, and wholesale deplatforming of some of the most vulnerable people because they just happen to live in the wrong geographies or happen to live under the wrong governments.*
* **Freedom of Association, Commerce, and Expression**: It’s unethical and immoral to remove the economic identity and agency of people. Freedom of association, commerce, and expression is the bedrock of the revolution that is cryptocurrencies.
* **Legacy Actors**: None of this means anything if we hand all those things to legacy actors. They have shareholders, they have businesses, they have to behave in no other way. Their whole point is to maximize their value and enhance their competitiveness.
   * **Power and Influence**: ***They get to decide your level of transactional privacy, your custodial standards, what is a wallet, what are your listing criteria and the governance therein, what chains are legitimate, what chains are not, what consensus is legitimate, what consensus is not, who gets liquidity and who doesn’t get liquidity, which jurisdictions, and dozens of other things.***
   * **Revolution**: Is that the revolution we signed up for? To have 10 companies come in and completely take over cryptocurrencies and basically run them and control them?
   * **Criticism**: If you attack and criticize the people who have this message, you have to really ask yourself who you are and why you are here.
   * **Centralization and Consequences**: Every day, there’s a struggle of telling the truth about where we’re going as an industry, whether it be the centralization or the lack thereof, the consequences of the Legacy financial industry coming in and what they do.
* **2008 Financial Crisis**: The 2008 financial crisis was a terrible time for a lot of us and so many people got hurt and victimized. The whole message of Satoshi is we can do something a little different and we can be different.
* **The Meta**: The Meta is the infrastructure, the owners, the technology that we embrace, and how that technology works together. The closer we get back to the Legacy, the more we lose.

Despite a $26.7 million inflow into spot Ether ETFs on August 1, Ethereum's fees have significantly decreased since March, showing reduced network activity. The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi has also dropped by over $10 billion since June.

Current support is around $3,000, with critical support at $2,700. Historical data suggests ETH has strong demand below $3,000, often bouncing back quickly. But will it hold this time?

*“Many people still view digital assets as a mystery, partly due to the industry’s focus on technology rather than practical use cases,”* Gradwell said in a statement, adding that his goal at Tether is *“to shift this conversation toward understanding how digital assets are used in the real economy, and how USDT is supporting dollar hegemony.”*

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino commented on Gradwell’s appointment, noting that his experience *“will enable Tether to bring even further understanding to our indispensable role in supporting the dollar.”*

I have been using Coinbase to buy Bitcoin and simply send those to my blockchain.com wallet

So far it seems easy enough all I have to do is search on Coinbase (tether) on the “buy” tab and the option to buy “Tether USDT” shows up. 

I always use my debit card to buy Bitcoin as this is much faster than using my bank account…should I purchase tether USDT with my debit card as well?


Now my next major question…can I send my tether usdt to my blockchain.com wallet? 
I noticed that when I search on the blockchain.com app “tether” many options pop up…however only one pops up saying it is for receiving USDT on the “Ethereum” network which is the choice “Tether defi wallet Ethereum”…is this the wallet I use to transfer my tether USDT from Coinbase? 


Thanks in advance for anyone that can help. :)>

You’ve heard this criticism before, I’m sure. And typically the first counter argument is usually “but fiat…” which is a stupid whataboutism so just stop. A disproportionate amount of crypto activity is dedicated to facilitating this kind of crime because exchanges and techbro investors profit from it. I personally think this is where a lot of the recent liquidity and pumping is coming from - mostly intra and post Covid Tether activity to prop up illicit activity.

Between Coinbase, Kraken (Payward Inc), and CryptoCom (Foris Dax Inc), spent over 1.25m USD. Coinbase was the largest spender, with 700k USD spent in the first quarter of 2024.   
  
The US is a key market for Coinbase, which is why it is likely more focused on advancing the regulatory framework in that jurisdiction than others. CB also has an ongoing case with the regulators.  
  
Coinbase also recently contributed 25m (matching contributions from Ripple and a16z) to a crypto PAC ahead of the upcoming presidential election in the US.

Cryptocom also matched its Q1 lobbying budget from last year, spending 260k at the beginning of the year (slightly down from 270k in 2023 but still double the amount spent in the same period in 2022).   
  
Most of this budget was likely spent lobbying the CFTC, as Cryptocom tries to toe the line by only launching tailored products for the jurisdiction, most recently the Strike options. [https://crypto.com/product-news/updown-options…](https://crypto.com/product-news/updown-options…)  
  
CDC planned to launch a full US exchange in the last bull market but ultimately decided against this due to regulatory uncertainty. Since then, it has opted for a piecemeal approach to entering the American market. Then in 2022, Cryptocom entered the game of US federal lobbying with force, spending over 1m USD on lobbying that year (in comparison, Kraken spent just over 400k in 2022 but has since ramped up its lobbying spend to match competitors).

Regulatory lobbying has advantages and disadvantages. One of the main benefits is that agencies gain access to knowledge from industry professionals, leading to better-quality rules (more informed and effective regulations). However, regulatory lobbying also has significant drawbacks. One major concern is the inequality of influence and the democratic deficit of lobbying."

Like Tether, but it's own blockchain. Secured by POW, seeded with a presale in which the government would spend all their USD to acquire the new token at a 1:1 issuance.

The government could store all the dollars at an institutuion as verified reserves, and after that, go on a fiat backed USD cryptocurrency standard, with no more fed/new money supply etc. The dollar would effectively become a hard asset that you could not make more of, with the total supply capped at whatever it is at the time of issuance. 

I could see this as more likely than reverting to a gold standard (but still very unlikely that the government would choose to give up the money printer)."

I am in Australia, I need to transfer very small but regular amounts of money (US$20 to 40 per week) to a wonderful person who lives overseas in a country under sanctions. The only way I can transfer money to them is via crypto.

All Australian banks are hardcore against crypto, so I cannot directly buy it. Until recently, I used Binance (and later ByBit) crypto exchange and bought crypto from people there via P2P using Wise to transfer them my AUD. My recipient was also registered on Binance, so the rest was straightforward.

This was halted when Wise blocked my transfers claiming they do not support crypto. To the best of my knowledge, Wise is the only possible channel to transfer $$ on crypto exchanges as the transaction should be less than 15 min. Bank transfers and such cannot work as P2P people are usually in other countries and can only wait for 15 min.

Seems like there is a global war on crypto. Not sure how I can do my little transfers now? I was going to try Revolut but then read too many stories of them being unreliable.

P.S. I prefer USDT (Tether) as I only use crypto as a means of transfer."

We can almost observe in real-time how the market reacts to this support level, which will likely dictate the asset's next direction.

  
If buyers cannot sustain the price above the crucial psychological level of $65,000, the coin may decline to the zones of $62,500–$63,500 and $60,880.   
  
However, such a drop should not be interpreted as the beginning of a trend reversal but rather as a correction within an overarching upward trend.

 For continued growth and to reach new highs, Bitcoin needs to break through the $70,900–$72,700 zone on significant trading volumes.   
  
Until this occurs, we can expect the market to remain flat for several more weeks.

***Proof-of-Work***

The first approach is proof-of-work, famously used by Nakamoto for Bitcoin and inherited by many other blockchains. In this approach, at a very high level, users race to solve a very complex cryptographic puzzle. The first one to solve the puzzle has the right to append the next block to the chain. Proof-of-Work suffers from several flaws.

*First Flaw: Proof-of-Work Does Not Scale.* Proof-of-work is very slow. Bitcoin’s crypto puzzles are so hard in order to guarantee that one solution is found only every 10 minutes, no matter how many miners try to solve the crypto puzzle. We can understand expensive and fast. But expensive and slow is hard to understand. The world is a large place and one block of transactions every 10 minutes is hardly enough.

*Second Flaw: Proof-of-Work Results in De-Facto Centralization.* Proof-of-work has caused a tremendous concentration of power. This centralization is a consequence of the fact that Proof-of-Work is both expensive and wasteful. The amount of computation performed by the *miners* — that is, the users trying to solve the crypto puzzles —is stunning. Mining today utilizes racks and racks of specialized hardware and consumes an enormous amount of electricity. One miner wins the race and generates the new block, and the efforts of all the others are wasted. Without the subsidies that Bitcoin currently offers, the cost of posting a single transaction on Bitcoin’s blockchain is around $20. Not the way to go if you want to use the blockchain for everyday transactions like buying a slice of pizza or if you want to use it offer financial services to those 2.2 billion who are currently not served by the financial system.

The common user would lose money if she tried to solve the crypto puzzle with her laptop. Win or lose, she must pay for the electricity necessary to power the computations of her laptop. This amount of electricity may not be big, but her probability of winning is so small that, in expectation, she would lose money.

Only professional miners, who have made the capital expenditure necessary to buy racks and racks of hyper specialized mining equipment, can expect to make a small profit. Accordingly, only they participate in block generation. Furthermore, miners consociate in *mining pools*.

Today, Bitcoin’s blockchain is controlled by just three mining pools and Ethereum’s by just two mining pools. If they so decide, or if they are bribed to do so, these mining pools can rewrite the database: they can erase blocks or change the order of blocks. Proof-of-work has turned what was intended to be a decentralized system into an extremely centralized one.

*Third Flaw: Proof-of-Work Is Not Secure.* As we said, any blockchain that is centralized, whether by design or *de facto*, is insecure. But proof-of-work has additional vulnerabilities, and it is especially vulnerable to network attacks. A blockchain ultimately is a communication protocol, and any such protocol is executed over an underlying communication network. An adversary may thus attack either the protocol — e.g., by sending messages that are different from the prescribed ones — or the communication network itself — e.g., by interfering with routers, cables, etc.

Just how insecure proof-of-work is may be underestimated because the current way of analyzing a blockchain’s security is flawed. This analysis typically focuses only on protocol attacks and neglects network attacks that, especially in the context of proof-of-work, can be deadly. For instance, in a proof-of-work blockchain, an adversary capable of partitioning the communication network for an hour or two could double-spend with impunity. In a successful partitioning attack, an adversary prevents the messages sent by the users belonging to a set of users A from reaching the users in a separate set B, and vice versa. Network partitioning has not attracted much attention, because it is considered too expensive to be practical. But the cost of a network attack may be justified, once the gains are high enough. A truly borderless economy may be valued in trillions of dollars. And an adversary may be willing to ‘invest’ millions of dollars, if he stands to illicitly gain billions of dollars.

*Fourth Flaw: Forks.* Another disadvantage of proof-of-work is the unavoidable existence of *forks*. Whenever two or more users solve the crypto puzzles within a few seconds of each other, the chain branches because users may now see multiple candidates for the next block. A fork may continue to exist for a while, and all its branches may even be elongated by the addition of new blocks. But eventually, all branches but one will die, and all the blocks in the dead branches will disappear.

Forks are an unwelcome source of uncertainty and delay. If a payment made to you appears in the latest block added to the chain, you cannot consider yourself paid and ship the goods. This is so because some branch may overcome the current chain and your block may end up in a dead branch and vanish. Before considering yourself paid, you would need to wait for a sequence of blocks to be added to yours, so as to minimize the chance that a soft fork will arise and the block containing your payment will end up on a dead branch.

How long should you wait for? Some people recommend six blocks to be added after yours to be confident that your block will remain on the chain. Others recommend an even longer wait, if the payment made to you is sizable. Thus, rather than waiting ten minutes, to have reasonable confidence in the finality of a transaction, in reality you have to wait hours.

Some people have suggested making the crypto puzzles easier in order to speed up the process, for instance by making it possible to find a solution every minute, rather than every 10 minutes. However, by doing so, the probability of getting two solutions within a few seconds of each other increases significantly. The system can cope with an occasional soft fork, but not with very frequent forks.

Expenses, slowness, and uncertainty are indeed major flaws in the proof-of-work approach, but they pale in comparison with its fatal flaw.

*The Fatal Flaw in Proof-of-Work.* Recall the already discussed fatal flaw: *the whole economy is at the mercy of a small part of the economy.*

In proof-of-work, this small part of the economy is that owned by the miners. Since the miners own only a small fraction of the money in a proof-of-work blockchain, the chain is not secure.

***Delegated Proof-of-Stake***

A different approach is delegated proof-of-stake (PoS). This is a very simple idea. The community empowers a few special users, the *delegates*, to choose the next block, at least for a while. (For example, in EOS, the number of the delegates is 21.)

Delegated PoS is, therefore, centralized from the get-go. Hopefully, the chosen delegates are honest to begin with. However, relying on delegates remaining honest for a long time is risky.

Once again, we have that *the whole economy is at the mercy of a small part of the economy.* Indeed, in a delegated-PoS blockchain the delegates may own a tiny fraction of the total money in the system, yet the whole blockchain is secure if and only if the majority of delegates are honest.

*Additional Security Problems.* Even assuming that there is an ironclad guarantee that all the delegates will remain honest forever, they can easily be attacked. In particular, they can be brought down by a denial of service (DoS) attack. In such an attack, an adversary bombards any user of his choice with zillions of junk messages, causing the buffer of that unfortunate user to overflow. If a delegate were so bombarded, he would be unable to perform his job, namely collating new and valid transactions into the next block. The blockchain would grind to a halt.

DoS attacks are quite cheap and can be mounted instantly against not only 21 people but even 1000 people. Since delegates are known, even if they were kept in power for just a day or an hour or a minute, a determined adversary could bring down all the delegates by a fast DoS attack.

***Bonded Proof-of-Stake***

Bonded PoS allows 20 users, 200 users, as many as are willing, to put some money on the table — a bond — where they can no longer touch it. These are the users who select the next block on behalf of all of us. If they misbehave, their money is confiscated.

Does this approach work?

Let me ask a simpler question: how much of your disposable income can you afford to put hostage on the table? The answer is a very small amount. Bonded PoS therefore, not only makes it possible, but actually makes it *easy* for big thieves with deep pockets to put a disproportionate amount of money on the table for the sole purpose of controlling the blockchain.

But so what? If they misbehave, they lose their hostage money. However, a truly decentralized, scalable and secure blockchain should secure trillions of dollars in assets. And by misbehaving, a malicious user stands to make a few billion dollars. This being the case, do you think that he may fear having a few million dollars confiscated? This is just the price of doing business. And it is a small price at that.

Once more, in bonded PoS, we have the same fatal flaw: *the whole economy is at the mercy of a small part of the economy.* Indeed, in a bonded PoS this small part of the economy consists of (the owners of) “the money laying hostage on the table.”

In sum, prior approaches suffer from several drawbacks. We need a better design.

**Algorand’s Logic and Pure Proof-of-Stake.** Algorand’s logic is simple: it ties the security of the whole economy to the honesty of the *majority* of the economy, and makes it impossible for a small subset of the economy to control the fate of the whole economy.

Algorand is based on a new Proof-of-Stake: *Pure* *PoS*. Essentially, a Pure PoS does not try to keep users honest by the fear of imposing fines. Rather, it makes cheating by a minority of the money impossible and cheating by a majority of the money stupid.

In Algorand no money is ever hostage. All money is always where it should be: in your wallet, at your fingertips ready to be spent, or in the various financial instruments that the Algorand blockchain offers you. When you take in consideration all the money in the system, wherever it may be, the system is secure when most of the money is in honest hands.

As we said, it is impossible for the owners of a small fraction of the money to harm the whole system, and it would be silly for the owners of the majority of the money to misbehave so as to devalue their own holdings.

For example, in proof-of-work or bonded PoS, a few users can prevent other users from transacting. In Algorand, only the owners of the majority of the money could prevent other users from transacting. But if they did so, the reputation of the currency would be greatly harmed, the currency would no longer universally accepted, and its purchasing power would be greatly diminished. Not a good outcome for the owners of the majority of the money.

**Implementing Pure PoS.** Let us now see how Algorand uses pure PoS for choosing the next block. Remember the trilemma? We want block generation to be simultaneously scalable, secure, and decentralized.

At a very high level, in Algorand, a new block is constructed in two phases.

* In the first phase, a single token is randomly selected, and its owner is the user who proposes the next block.
* In the second phase, 1000 tokens are selected among all tokens currently in the system. The owners of these 1000 tokens are selected to be part of a phase-2 ‘committee,’ which approves the block proposed by the first user.

Accordingly, some member of the committee may be chosen twice or more generally some k times, in which case, that member will have k votes in the committee to approve the next block.

Why is the second phase necessary?

In any society, and blockchains are no exception, there is always a small percentage of bad actors to be found; let us say 1 percent. Maybe 2 percent. If one is unfortunate enough to live in a very dangerous society, 10 percent may be bad actors. Perhaps even 20 percent! But in no society will bad actors be in a majority; otherwise, there would not be a society. A society exists insofar as the majority of its members follow prescribed rules.

Assume that 10 percent of the tokens in Algorand belong to dishonest people. Then, one in ten times, the user selected in phase 1 to propose a block may be a bad actor. Accordingly, he may tell some users that the block is X and other users that the block is Y and so on and so forth, thereby creating disagreement about what the blockchain is.

Phase 2 eliminates this problem. Indeed, if you select at random 1000 tokens when at most 10 percent of the tokens are in dishonest hands, the probability that the majority of the selected coins belong to bad actors, that is, the probability that the majority of the committee’s votes are cast by bad actors is so low as to be negligible.

Assume that, this time around, you have not been selected to propose a block. Nor have you been selected to be part of a committee to approve a proposed block. But you see that a given block B has been approved by, say, 700 votes of the committee. Then, you know that B is indeed the next block.

**A Key Question.** At this high-level description, several questions naturally arise. Let us start with the most obvious one: *Who randomly chooses the committee?*

Suppose I tell you that I do. Then you might say “That is the most centralized system ever, and you are at the center of it!” Suppose I tell you that all users discuss until they agree on a thousand committee members who then agree on the block. Then you might tell me that, humanity being what it is, an entire lifetime is not going to be enough to select the thousand committee members that we require.

Algorand takes an unorthodox approach: *the committee members select themselves.* You may think “What? That is a terrible idea! Because if I am a bad actor, I am going to select myself to be a member of this committee. And the next. And the one after that…” But not so fast.

To belong to the committee, one of your coins must win an individual, cryptographically fair lottery that you run in isolation — that is, without talking to anyone else — in the privacy of your own computer. And since the lottery is cryptographically fair, you cannot alter the chances of being selected in the slightest. (Not even a nation state with huge computational resources would be able to increase the probability of being selected.)

To select 1,000 random tokens among, say, 10,000,000,000 tokens, each token is selected with probability 1,000/10,000,000,000 — i.e., with probability 1 in 10 million.

So, as soon as a user sees a block being proposed, she asks herself: can I be a member of the committee selected to approve a block? And how many votes will I have?

To answer these questions, she runs the cryptographic lottery on her laptop for each one of the tokens that she owns. (If a user has n tokens, additional technology essentially allows her to run a single lottery instead of n separate lotteries!)

Once a user runs her lottery, one of two cases occurs. Either none of her tokens wins the lottery, in which case whatever opinion she expresses about the block will be ignored. Or some k>1of her tokens win the lottery, in which case, she obtains a winning ticket, namely a short proof that everybody can easily verify that she has k votes in the committee. In this latter case, she propagates through the network (i) a winning ticket proving that she has k votes and (ii) her opinion about the block.

**Solving the Trilemma**. Let me argue that this sketched approach is — finally! — simultaneously scalable, secure, and decentralized.

*Scalability.*

How long does it take for a user to run her own lottery? Roughly a microsecond, no matter how many tokens she has. That is indeed superfast. (Additionally, all the lotteries are run independently of each other, so that no user has to wait for other users to finish running their lotteries.)

Once selected, each member propagates to the network a single, short and immediately computed message. So no matter how many users are in the system, the maximum number of messages that need to be propagated is 1000 short messages. Is this scalable? Yes!

*Security.*

Now we come to security. Assume that I am a very powerful adversary, capable of corrupting users extremely quickly whenever I want. Clearly, I would love to corrupt the members of the committee, but I have a problem: I do not know who they are.

This is so because committee members are selected by a secretly run, cryptographically fair, individual lottery. Thus, only they know who they are, up to the moment in which they propagate through the network both their winning tickets and their opinions about the block. Only at that time I might learn who the committee members are and, given my super powers, I can immediately corrupt the entire committee. But so what? Corrupting them at this time is too late. Whatever the committee members had to say, they have already said, and their winning tickets and up-or-down opinions about the block are virally propagating throughout the network. I have no more power to put their messages back in the bottle than a government has the power to put back in the bottle messages virally propagated by WikiLeaks.

In other words, the Algorand approach is secure because beforehand, an adversary does not know whom to corrupt, and by the time he does, corruption is useless.

Contrast this with having a fixed 1000-strong committee. As discussed before, even if the committee stayed in power for a minute, it would be vulnerable to a DoS attack. If the committee stayed in power for much longer, say a week, then the members could even be corrupted in the physical world via traditional means such as bribes. In Algorand’s case however, one would not know against whom to mount a DoS attack and once the committee has spoken, the DoS attack is useless.

*Decentralization.*

Finally, we come to decentralization. Are there a few users in charge of choosing the next block? No, there are not. Nor is there a fixed, 1000-strong, committee in charge of approving the block. This time, a committee has been randomly (and secretly) selected. Next time, a different committee will be randomly (and secretly) selected. Everybody has the chance of participating in the generation of a new block.

*Algorand’s Non-Forkable Chain.*

An additional advantage of Algorand’s technology is that its chain never forks. This is so because only one block can have the required threshold of committee votes. Accordingly, in Algorand all transactions are final. Once a block appears, you can count on it to be forever part of the chain. And if the new block contains a payment made to you, you may consider yourself paid and send the goods immediately.

The financial world has already its own risks and there is no need to burden it with the additional uncertainty of \`block disappearance.’ By the way, when I said that Algorand’s chain never forks, I somewhat lied. Indeed, forks may occur in Algorand but they are very rare. The probability of forking in Algorand is, by design, 10⁻¹⁸. This probability may appear a strange choice, but it actually has a natural explanation. Physicists tell us that 10¹⁸ happens to be the number of seconds from the Big Bang until now. In other words, if you produce a block a second, a very good clip by the way, you may see a soft fork, but you would have to wait for the lifetime of the universe to see it."
Ethereum,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1h4aa6f/i_analyzed_ben_cowens_predictions_and_made_a/,1h4aa6f,I analyzed Ben Cowen's predictions and made a spreadsheet + video about it,2024-12-01 18:48:12.000000,"**TL;DR:** A detailed analysis of Benjamin Cowen's crypto predictions in 2023 reveals a surprisingly poor track record. Out of 17 predictions analyzed, 15 were wrong, 1 was partially correct, and only 1 was fully accurate. [Link to the video is **here**.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FId5Ji-Tw0E)

I don't want to waste anyone's time (+ ADHD here) so I'll get right into it. 

**METHODOLOGY**

I made a spreadsheet ([available here] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uglm1iXVYqLXjYGah6_co7agDBlXK4i7ZuMC6aZrHaE/edit?usp=sharing)) where I kept track of Ben's exact statements and predictions regarding Bitcoin (price and dominance), Ethereum, and altcoins. The idea behind it wasn't to publish this or make a video about it - it was to use it for my own sanity, because I felt many of his predictions fell short, but could never point my finger as to why. I focused on predictions made in 2023 for fair evaluation, since some need months/years to play out. Then, I methodically checked each prediction against actual market performance and noted if it panned out or not. I made a video about it because, honestly, it's easier and faster to follow than clicking on each link in the spreadsheet. I'm not a youtuber, I don't need your subs, and this is the only video I'll ever publish. I just want to inform you.

**CONCLUSIONS**

Out of 17 statements that I followed up on, 15 ended up not panning out. 1 was partially correct, and another one was fully correct. Ben's predictions missed on the timing component, the value component, or both (in most cases). I won't go into specific statements - you have either the spreadsheet or the video to take a look at.

**TAKEAWAY**

In the end, this isn't about Ben at all. It's about EVERY YouTube and X crypto personality you follow. Here's the critical advice:

* Document EXACT statements - when an influencer makes a prediction, write down the EXACT words, including specific price targets, time frames, and conditions.

* Beware of narrative shifting - many influencers have a habit of slowly tweaking their narrative. They'll subtly modify their original statement over time so that when something eventually happens, they can claim they ""predicted"" it.

* Time and value matter - a prediction isn't just about being right eventually. The specific time frame and exact value are crucial. If someone predicts Bitcoin will hit $100k ""sometime in the future"", that's not a real prediction.

Start a spreadsheet. Track the precise claims. Compare them to actual market performance. You'll be shocked how often ""expert"" predictions fall apart under scrutiny.

Bottom Line: Do your own research. Be critical. Don't worship any single crypto influencer, no matter how popular they are."

These are not hype-driven projects, but rather ones with **consistent APR%** that have shown reliability.

I’ll present **2 established projects** ^((maybe hated)) and **1 new project**. Let’s dive in!  
This post is not about whether the token is good or bad, but only about high APR gains and a passive income.

1️⃣ **Ontology (ONT)**

**APR**: 25-35%  
**Payout**: after a staking Cycle (several days, around 21 days)

Ontology uses a **dual-token model**, where staking ONT in your wallet earns you **ONG (Ontology Gas)**. This second token is used to pay transaction fees and represents a steady income stream.

2️⃣ **NEO**

**APR**: 15-22%  
**Payout**: every second, refresh your wallet and claim instantly your rewards

NEO is one of the early pioneers in the blockchain space, often referred to as the ""Chinese Ethereum."" By staking NEO, you earn **GAS tokens**, which power transactions on the network.

3️⃣ **Aethir (ATH)**

**APR**: 5% - 275%  
**Payout**: Every week on Thursday

Aethir is a fresh, cutting-edge project focusing on **decentralized cloud infrastructure** for AI, gaming, and metaverse applications. By running **Checker Nodes**, you can earn attractive staking rewards. You can chose between AI Staking or Gaming Staking. The longer you lock your coins, the more APR you get. The maximum is 4 years. **Aethir has a large number of partners** (you get a lot of bonus) and they give Aethir users coins in the form of airdrops or discounts on other nodes. Everyone who has been with Aethir since the beginning should have an APR of about 400% which is paid out weekly.

If you find a good entry point, the staking rewards will pay off in the long term, even in a bear market. You can generate a good passive income. If you are interested i can tell more details or show statistics of a passive income."

This is the response.,2024-11-27 20:15:01.000000,"Investing in cryptocurrencies can be lucrative but comes with significant risks due to their high volatility and unpredictable nature. Here’s a general strategy for investing responsibly and aiming for the best return on investment (ROI):

1. Do Your Research (DYOR)

	•	Understand the Market: Learn how cryptocurrencies work, including blockchain technology, market trends, and economic factors affecting prices.
	•	Study Projects: Focus on cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals—real-world use cases, active development teams, and transparent roadmaps.
	•	Analyze Risk Levels: Recognize the difference between established coins (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) and high-risk altcoins or meme coins.

2. Diversify Your Portfolio

	•	Balance Risk: Allocate funds across various coins to reduce risk. For example:
	•	Blue-Chip Cryptos: Bitcoin, Ethereum—low risk, steady growth potential.
	•	Altcoins: Polkadot, Solana, or other emerging platforms—higher risk, higher potential ROI.
	•	Speculative Tokens: Only a small portion of your investment—extremely high risk.
	•	Avoid putting all your money into a single cryptocurrency.

3. Use Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

	•	Invest a fixed amount regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly) instead of trying to time the market.
	•	Reduces the impact of volatility and helps you accumulate assets over time.

4. Focus on Long-Term Holding

	•	HODLing: Hold onto high-potential assets for several years to benefit from long-term growth rather than chasing short-term gains.
	•	Historically, coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum have rewarded long-term holders despite market crashes.

5. Stay Updated

As the cryptocurrency world sails through turbulent seas of innovation, regulation, and mass adoption, a surprising new force may soon chart its course: the MAGA and MAHA communities. With Donald Trump’s potential initiatives to establish America as the crypto capital of the world, the intersection of these movements and the crypto community could signal a transformative era for digital assets. Here’s why this potential alliance matters—and what it could mean for the future of finance.

# Understanding MAGA and MAHA in the Context of Crypto

**MAGA**: Rooted in principles of economic strength and American exceptionalism, MAGA promotes policies aimed at revitalizing American industries and fostering technological leadership. The crypto industry—an innovative and rapidly growing sector—aligns with MAGA’s vision of reclaiming global dominance in cutting-edge markets.

**MAHA**: Focused on health and sustainability, MAHA encourages policies that prioritize long-term prosperity and the well-being of communities. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have faced criticism for their environmental impact, could find synergy with MAHA’s goals by embracing greener blockchain technologies and promoting financial inclusion.

# Donald Trump’s Vision: America as the Crypto Capital

Donald Trump has historically expressed skepticism about cryptocurrency but has also demonstrated a penchant for bold, transformative strategies. If he aims to make America the crypto capital of the world, several key initiatives could come into play:

1. **Pro-Crypto Regulations**: Streamlined, business-friendly regulations could make the U.S. a haven for blockchain innovation, attracting companies and developers.
2. **National Blockchain Adoption**: By integrating blockchain into federal operations (e.g., voting systems, healthcare, and supply chains), America could set a global standard.
3. **Financial Sovereignty**: Trump’s platform could emphasize crypto as a tool for bypassing reliance on foreign banking systems and strengthening the dollar’s global influence.

# How MAGA and MAHA Could Reshape the Crypto Landscape

**1. Mass Adoption Through Political Mobilization**  
The MAGA and MAHA communities represent millions of Americans who may not yet be deeply engaged with cryptocurrency. A political push could bring these groups into the fold, leveraging their economic and ideological commitment to drive mass adoption of crypto as a national priority.

**2. Green Blockchain Initiatives**  
MAHA’s emphasis on health and sustainability aligns with the growing trend toward eco-friendly cryptocurrencies. Policies promoting proof-of-stake networks (e.g., Ethereum 2.0) or incentivizing renewable energy use in crypto mining could merge these goals.

**3. Infrastructure Investment**  
A MAGA-driven push for American industrial revitalization could lead to significant investments in blockchain infrastructure—creating jobs, fostering innovation, and ensuring the U.S. remains competitive in the digital economy.

**4. Crypto and Healthcare Synergy**  
MAHA’s focus on health could integrate blockchain technology into healthcare systems, enabling secure data sharing, reducing fraud, and improving efficiency. Crypto incentives could even be tied to wellness initiatives, promoting healthier lifestyles.

# Challenges and Opportunities

While this potential alignment offers immense promise, it also comes with challenges:

* **Regulatory Clarity**: Balancing innovation with consumer protection remains a delicate task.
* **Environmental Concerns**: Aligning crypto with MAHA’s sustainability goals will require ongoing technological advancements.
* **Political Polarization**: The ideological divide surrounding crypto and Trump’s leadership could hinder bipartisan support.

Opportunities, however, abound:

* **Crypto Education**: MAGA and MAHA could spearhead initiatives to educate the public on blockchain technology, fostering broader understanding and adoption.
* **Global Leadership**: A unified crypto strategy could position America as a beacon for innovation, attracting global talent and investments.

# The Future of Crypto in Trump’s America

If Trump and his MAGA/MAHA allies champion cryptocurrency, the ripple effects could be profound:

* **Accelerated Adoption**: Millions of new users could join the crypto ecosystem.
* **Policy Innovation**: Pro-crypto legislation could set the stage for a blockchain-driven economy.
* **Cultural Shift**: Cryptocurrencies could move from niche to mainstream, woven into the fabric of American economic identity.

# Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto?

The merger of MAGA, MAHA, and the cryptocurrency community could herald a new chapter in the digital revolution. With Trump’s leadership emphasizing innovation and national strength, America could emerge as a global leader in crypto—fueling economic growth, technological advancement, and financial sovereignty.

# Start

The year is 2024, you are seeing bitcoin and crypto coming into your timeline more and more. USA just elected a president who is pro crypto. Elon Musk is jumping up and down on Trump rally and he's also pro crypto. You are wondering ""is this just internet magic money? Is this a ponzi scheme? Why the heck would I use a currency , fiat already exists. There are no additional use cases""



# The Ideology

^(You can ignore this part if you are already tired of reading similar summary over and over again. Remember this is MY opinion and does not reflect everyone's opinion. This part also has a lot of compiled conspiracy theory and not my own.)

1912, Titanic just sank and took down old banking system. The Rothschild bankers and few others who happened to be off the boat, has now gripped the world financial system. Federal Reserve which can indefinitely print money supply in exchange for gold was established in 1913. WW1 and WW2 followed shortly which introduced massive amounts of temporary tax (we still are in that temporary taxation system). Till 1970, we had this certificate (now fiat money) , that was printed and backed by Gold, oil and few other global commodities. The more commodity a country had, the more value it's printed certificate (dollar, rupee etc.) had. Gold and oil was the ""native liquidity currency"". Remember this: ""native liquidity currency"". USA being the new super leader, decided to hoard as much gold and oil possible by dealing with as many countries as possible. US dollar or any other fiat currency had this pair ($ Country's money / Gold)

1971, USA has a significant amount of gold, and oil, and a grip on the world. USSR (now Russia) was and still is it's arch rival. By now, USA has already made a few great decision for itself by establishing itself as a world native liquidity currency. ***USA decided to depeg the gold from it's native liquidity.*** 

Which means before it was ***($ USD / Gold ) but now it's ($ USD / \_\_\_\_)***. Where as the rest of the world was ($ Rupee / USD), ($Yen / USD). Trades were and still happens in USD, even now. If you want to send a shipment of paint from China to Bangladesh, it's done in USD. Not yen, not taka.  

**Now the question is, if my country's currency has a US dollar reserve and USD is being treated as one of the major liquidity currency, what about USD? What is USD's own native liquidity pair?  :)**   
**I will leave the history of 1971-2000s fill out your imagination.** 

  
From the 1900 - 2000, the old banking system has significantly shifted from being Gold backed to US dollar backed. USA is also printing as much as it wants out of thin air with nothing but war behind it's liquidity backing. Any country that is trying to get back to gold or oil standard has been uprooted. So paper money is literally being made from trees. 

***Fiat currency supply keeps going up, value keeps going down. If USA prints, your country's currency is gaining strength but that all depends on whether they are NOT printing themselves. This macro economics majorly affects us and crypto every single day. The key for your country is to stop printing while USA prints.*** 

  
Your parents have immediately felt the affects of this depegging over 1970s - 2000s. Everything inflated fast. Their salary was not that far off of inflated value of homes, cars, food. Taxes were not that bad, it was supposed to be temporary but it was acceptable. 

You were born in the 80s - 2000s, now you are either in your 20s or your 40s. You are in this subreddit trying to figure out how do you get rich via crypto and how to get out of this rut. Where's this get rich quick scheme?

  
2009 - Satoshi (a person or group of people or psyop by the banking system), invented BTC Bitcoin. Digital currency that can't be printed. The idea that one day it will become a native liquidity currency like gold or oil. Unhackable because you'd have to hack all the mining computers all at once. Mining means you use your computer to act as part of the ledger system that keeps transactions all in sync and calculated while solving a formula to SLOWLY mine 21 million bitcoin (total). All of a sudden you can send money overseas without any issues, albeit transaction fee is expensive af. However, this is the only thing banks and feds cannot touch or tax(However, we all know decentralized - they cannot, centralized - they can, we will dive in to this later). You can hold on to it and battle this unlimited printing of fiat. You know rest of the usual story that people say so we won't be diving more into this. 



# Deep dive into Defi

Decentralized is a word that gets thrown around every where. Everyone claims to be decentralized in crypto and btc subforums. However, 90% of the people are just buying and holding in CEX (centralized exchanges like binance). They are then selling it for USDT for profit or loss, and sending it back to their banks for fiat. They were never decentralized. They don't use bitcoin for anything. They don't use ethereum for anything. They don't use solana for anything. 

  
So what can you use these coins for? Is it just for silk road like the early bitcoin days? I pay someone in btc and someone gives me the limited edition pokemon card on ebay?  Sure, but no.

  
DeFi truly started during introduction of Ethereum by an alpha centauri alien called Vitalik. It didn't have a max supply like bitcoin, it was exactly like fiat in the sense that you can print it. However, printing was not controlled by the ETH foundation, it was printed by miners. You had to mine it. Why would we buy eth if it's still being printed? 

  
ETH had 3 tricks up it's sleeve. 

1. dApps (decentralized apps - it's what apps are to smart phones - whaaaat?)
2. Layer 2 EVMs (make your own network - wow!)
3. tokens (its like a coin, you can attach a name to)

>  
If Bitcoin is gold , Ethereum is silver. Gold is a store of value, where silver is a tool

  
**2018 - The birth of Uniswap:**

dApp builders like myself started scrambling and figuring out what to make. What can we all make in this brand new finance world? 

One of the first key things that came out was Uniswap. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange. Anyone can make a token and upload it with eth as it's native liquidity pair (token/ETH). In return Uniswap gave that user a liquidity pool token which is like a key that you can use to unlock the pair and pull out the money if they wanted. 

No more applying to CEX like binance for listing your own project, no more accredited investor status required for buying and selling things, no tax (controversial), and definitely cannot be frozen by banks. 

You can buy and sell any token that you want, you can make your own token (if you knew how to code in ethereum smart contract language called solidity), and you can make your token tradeable via uniswap. All you had to do was go on subforums and talk about your own tokens. What you needed was a wallet like metamask with actual ETH (not in CEX), you needed to press wallet connect on uniswap, and spend that ETH to buy tokens, or sell tokens to get some ETH. There were no middle men. No one can hack uniswap. 

  
Now what happened really? Our core degenerate mindset got us to start building shitcoins by now. 99% of the tokens on uniswap are scams, the users just unlocked and withdrew the liquidity (ETH) with the liquidity pool token. What if the token smart contract was a scam by itself? I will put a list of things for you to see before you buy any shitcoins directly on uniswap.  

\----   
  
**2020 - The birth of DxSale, and other launchpads**

Ah, this is something that takes you to some of the golden age of shitcoins. DxSale and Unicrypt made it easy for anyone to make a token. You didn't need to know how to write contracts anymore, those defi apps made it for you and you own it. Your wallet owns the token as the creator. You can make a token within seconds without knowing how to code, and raise funds in those same apps. Once the funds are raised, it automatically uploaded the token/ETH as a liquidity pair on Uniswap. Uniswap returned the liquidity pool token to the Launchpad smart contracts which automatically locked the liquidity pool (LP) token (key). This solved the number one issue with Uniswap launches, which is scam by unlocking LP and disappearing in to thin air. 

Great, now all you had to do was marketing and you have a token on ethereum, you could either try to launch it hard and make your coin go 100x or if you were a scam - you would've just found another way like dump the team tokens or perhaps add ""fee system""

Out came the rebase tokens, fee tokens, burn tokens etc. People started making custom tokens with some sort of fee at every buys and sells. Scammers decided to make buy fee 1% and sell fee 99%. You can buy but not sell, even if you buy it on launchpads like Dxsale or Dex like Uniswap. Scammers just like to abuse the system in deFi. It's the wild west. You either made a 83500x (yes it happened), or you lost it all. You probably lost it all if you were there in the wild west of 2021. 

dAPP builders though sold the shovels by making these apps in Ethereum and other L2s. The great part is, when we made these apps for Ethereum, it worked on Layer 2 networks like coinbase's Base network, so when another network became popular because of degenerate gamblers - these dApps already supported it. For example Binance smart chain network (BSC) was really popular around 2021-2022. Instead of using eth, people would use BNB to use these apps or make any transaction, BNB was the native currency and liquidity currency of BSC. 



>Was it all just financial or were there other use cases for Ethereum apps?

  
**NFTs: The type of token we never wanted but we still got**

Out came NFTs, ah NFTs... the middle child no one wants to talk about any more. NFTs were tokens that were not divisible. You cannot divide them like a regular token. Which means they had a different use case. You cannot really make it uniswap tradable because you had to buy a full NFT not a 0.00000001 of an NFT. All you can do is list your NFTs and some one else purchases it. 

Instantly, it became synonymous with art (jpegs). dApps like Rarible came out and started trying to be a marketplace for making and listing your NFTs. Some of you paid 100k for a ape's picture. I myself was not into NFTs except for my attempt at building an NFT fighting game. 

Eventually scammers found their way into NFT world as well. They used it to sell NFTs but never build anything else after that. Other ways they've used it is to launder money that they've made from scamming from traditional tokens. NFTs died as fast as they came.

  
**Farming**

One of the best use cases of dApps was farming apps like Beefy. You can earn an apy by using providing liquidity to Beefy farms. You can make a 6-11% by using USDT or a variation of USD (stable coins) which was a safe-ish way to make money. (Luna usd was not safe as we all know).  My own experience with farming was subpar at most, but it's my fault - i was scared of flash crashes of any coins whether they were a good coin or not. However, this is much safer than the shitcoin wild west of launchpads and uniswap. Farming is sort of like managed savings account, you manage the farm you want to gather apy from and hope nothing crashed and wiped you out. 

  
Till 2023, Ethereum and EVMs (Layer 2 networks) looked like it had all the game on their hands. All the app developers are on it. ""There are no other ethereum killer"". Plenty of different networks came and went. I remember trying to learn a different network's code and it just was not worth learning at the time... it was going great for us until... fire nation attacked (Solana). 

\-----   
  
**2024 Solana and it's golden child Pump fun with it's dex Raydium.**

Solana is a different network. It's not a layer 2 of Ethereum. Holy smokes its fast, holy smokes it doesn't work sometimes but when it does, im not spending $10 when i buy or sell a shitcoin. What's uniswap? Raydium is here. Dxsale? Nah son, it's pump fun. No more putting token amount, and calculating how many tokens I get as a developer, and how much for marketing yada yada yada. All it took on pump fun was $1 worth of solana and my solana token was live. I can just live stream on twitch and market my shitcoin. Just last night (relative to when im writing this on nov 24), some guy had his girlfriend inside a cage on twitch and raising funds on pump fun. No more locking liquidity, we burn the liquidity. 

Scammers are no longer only using technical tactics to scam, scammers have gotten dumber but bolder. They're scamming on live stream and showing their face. 

Solana started getting hot, it went 10x within a year due to so many people switching from ETH and other EVMs to play on this hot shiny new tech. Out with solidity coding, Rust is my new best friend. Ethereum killer? Yet to find out, but this is the only network that came this close.

You want to be in this new wild west? All you need is Phantom wallet with Real Solana (not CEX solana), connect to dApps like raydium or pump fun and start your degeneracy. Just like 2021, either you make 80,000x or zero. Most of the time you lose everything.

I was one of the loser dApp founders who decided not to sell shovels in this new wild west of Solana. I am now outwitted by Solana companies.   
\-----

**Bridge:**

So how do you stay decentralized while moving funds from ETH/EVM L2s to the new wild west solana? Thats where bridge ""dApp"" came from. The reason I put quotation is because they are not quite decentralized. They have some sort of code in between to move funds from one network to other for you with a fee. However by doing this, you avoid putting large sums of money into an exchange and getting it stuck due to whatever reasons. Perhaps you wanted to avoid identification (KYC) and linking it to your bank. deBridge is a very good bridge that everyone uses. Very easy to use. 

Bridges have been prone to be hacked due to their centralized nature in between the networks. Cross chain bridges are easier to hack than any dApps. 

  
\----   
**How do you avoid getting scammed or hacked or just in general lose money in Defi?**

* If you are diving into the old world of EVMs, remember the tokens can have variable fees like I've mentioned before. Use tools like tokensniffer to see if it's something similar. If a coin has 99% sell fee, it means you can buy but cannot sell.
* Check dextools or dexscreeners for the shitcoin to see how much liquidity is there, whether it's locked on Dxlock or Unicrypt, or whether it's burned. 
* Check if it's a honey pot. Many times, a hot token on these chart apps will have 150k liquidity but only 500 holders. If it's 150k liquidity, assume it should have over 3000 holders. 
* Check if it's a CTO (Community take over coin). Many scammers now a days rug pull their own coins, and perform a CTO with another telegram or twitter account. They pretend to be community member who's hell bent on getting this shitcoin up and running again. They rug it for the second time. Avoid CTOs.
* I highly suggest checking solana based token's advice on how to check for scams as I am not the best person for Solana based shitcoin scams. 
* Never connect to unknown dApps. Defi is a world where YOU are responsible. Some dApps out there can drain your wallet. Do not connect or sign things on your wallet that you don't know what it's for. Always do your research on the dApps. 
* If you are new and not used to trenches, be prepared to lose 99.99% of your sol or eth on shitcoins. That's how you learn what to look out for, honestly..
* Do not buy NFTs at the moment, they are dead.
* If you are not within the first 10 buyers of a hot shitcoin, you are last. You will be exit liquidity. Many marketcaps reach 10 million market cap then back down to 100k. It is what it is. Buy high sell low logic applies almost every time.

  
\----

**2027 and beyond - Has bitcoin become a dinosaur? What's next for DeFi?**

  
This is a very good topic and maybe an insight that you'd like to know for the next in this crypto wild west of Defi. Yes bitcoin is old, bitcoin is slow. However, bitcoin has and always will be king. It does not print like eth or solana.

But what about making shitcoins on Bitcoin? Can Bitcoin have something like Eth or Sol?

  
There already is something like that, it's called ""Runes"". Runes is a HOT new protocol that uses Bitcoin's messaging system to let you make tokens (they're called runes on bitcoin). It's a slow protocol currently which takes about 10 minutes to 30 minutes for a transaction and costs alot. It congests bitcoin miners. 

Crypto is all about the hot new thing. The hot new thing always comes one cycle earlier and gets popular in the next cycle. I will explain the cycles in the next topic. One hot shitcoin equivalent of runes is called DOG\*GO\*TO\*THE\*MOON ($DOG). It's the biggest rune currently on the bitcoin ecosystem. Its around 1B mcap already. 

Why am I mentioning Runes? I am not sure whether Runes will be the next big thing. However I do know one thing, bitcoin has the biggest maxis and biggest share of the market. Runes protocol opened up DeFi for bitcoin. If you want to make your own runes, you can download Magic Eden Wallet or Phantom Wallet, and use Magic Eden Wallet to trade runes.

Using the same messaging system, there's also an NFT equivalent called ""Ordinals"". I would not buy Ordinals , it will suffer the same fate as NFTs. 

The beauty of Runes is that the native currency is Bitcoin. There are no other coins that you need to buy before you dive into Runes shitcoin narratives. Could it beat 2024 Solana world? Who knows? All I know is, a few dApp builders are racing to solve a few problems with the runes ecosystem including myself. 

>  
What about SUI? My crypto friend was talking about SUI at work

  
Do your own research about SUI. It could also very well be the next Solana. SUI is much faster than Bitcoin Runes so it's easy to use. Only time will tell whether a slow titan (Bitcoin) or a small chain like SUI will win the next cycles hype.

\----

  
**Narrative advice**

Every cycle, check for the next narrative. You can buy and hope that your picks become the hot new topic in the next cycle. Something that is brewing now like bitcoin runes shitcoins or dapps OR sui native coin, sui shit tokens or dapps might be the winner in 2027. It's upto the dApp developers to come up with the hot new shovel that will drive these type of narratives. 



# Crypto Cycles and Insight

I am sure you've heard about the bitcoin halving cycles and have learned that majority of the people use these cyclical nature to buy low and sell high. 6 months post halving is when bull run tends to start. A few months later Alt season where the alt coins (ETH, Solana etc.) start to run and it ends with a bang with memes. 

However, in 2024, we've started with memes. There was a huge pump before halving and some people are saying that the cycle is left shifted. Others are saying that this is a super cycle. No matter what happens and have already happened, if you look at the chart, 2022 was the lowest point that your crypto expert friend have DCA'd through. They have already expected that halving or around halving will be the bull run. So far they look like geniuses, but a dump will come again eventually. It's your job to understand how the previous cycles worked and how this cycle is so far. Find similarities and differences between the previous cycles and this cycle. 

Some example of similarities:

* Halving again called the bull run (controversial I know - you may have another opinion)
* BTC climbing before alt season truly starts
* We are in phase 4 of bitcoin cycle (again controversial)
* We are in Belief or Thrill stage in psychology of market  (controversial)

  
Some examples of differences:

* Meme season started first this time around
* Pre halving pump
* Institutional acceptance (American and Global ETFs)

  
With these differences, you must make your own judgement. Does institutional acceptance mean a super cycle? Do these new boomers who buy the ETFs pull out fast because they think a gain of 20% is a gain of 2 years ? But crypto is used to 300% - 400% minimum.. what happens now? 

No one knows honestly, and everyone's entry point is different. It's up to you when you want to enter. You can either enter now in this part of cycle or enter during a bear market in 2 years. What if the bear market does not come for 4 years? Do you just sit on fiat?

Only YOU can make your decision, I am just here to provide you with some history and narrative.   


>Okay I want to enter now, what are my options? What are the narratives? I understood Defi and bitcoin cycles but what about meme , AI or gaming narratives? 

  
Meme season is a very risky season, the pumps will come without any build up and dump before you can pull out. The pumps usually last 1 day before a 90% dump

AI and Gaming are a hit or miss, you can do your own research to see whether any of those coins pumped right before halving. If they did, perhaps they are the winning horse you want to take on. 

>Overall, do your own research into the winning horses and sit tight. If they're already in All time high (ATH), perhaps avoid it since it's in ""price discovery"". Once it's in price discovery you must be ready to DCA out (take profits), instead of timing the top. No one knows where the top is. **Currently Alt Season has yet to start. Bitcoin needs to stop before Alts pump.**

  


Macroeconomics

This is another controversial topic as others may have other opinions but aside from halving where the supply is cut, interest rate of Global liquidity (USD) still has a large part to play with bitcoin price. When they print USD out of thin air for cheap (low interest), investors tend to put it into stocks , real estate and crypto. With halving cutting the supply of fresh bitcoin, and interest rates dropping - bitcoin price against USD is climbing hard and fast.  

ETFs in the west have also put a strain on the demand. Demand has outweighed so much that every day the boomers are purchasing 40 days of fresh supply of bitcoin. Currently they're buying OTC (over the counter) in bulk from bitcoin holders who held for years. They're not buying from the exchanges.. if they did, the price would've shot up much more. However, there will come a time where OTC dries up and they either tap into cex, and dex or their ETF prices start to climb. This will make bitcoin price go up regardless. 

When Bitcoin and it's ETFs have climbed to a significant amount of market cap, they will jump into ETH ETFs. That will signal the alt season and alt coins will start to climb. 

There are 2 rumoured Solana ETF filings in 2024 as well. 

^(I am sure, you guys are very well versed in macro economics, it would be great to have more additions into this chapter here. This is a deep topic that requires your help.)

# Do's and Don'ts

1. If you are new, do not have expectations with memecoins or shitcoins. DYOR. If you are not first 10 you are last.
2. If you are new, avoid price discovery coins. Buy coins that climbed before halving (winning horses) but not yet ATH from earlier. They will reach their ATH and go past ATH into price discovery. Examples below:
   1. ETH - Not yet price discovery
   2. SOL - Just flirting with price discovery and ATH
   3. BTC - Well into price discovery
3. If you are in Defi wild west, please read the DeFi section to understand the game. Start with money you are okay with losing. Get into X spaces, X and telegram / discord groups before you buy blindly. Read the smart contracts or use token sniffer or charting tools to look at tokenomics and metrics.
4. If you are getting into building, look at new narratives rather than current narratives. You are already too late. 
5. If you are a shitcoin owner, please know that scamming will get you caught. I have seen too many getting caught and its well deserved.
6. Do not believe X influencers or Youtubers, when they're shilling something, they're usually in on it. 
7. Do not blindly believe any thing you read on Yahoo Finance, and any other crypto news outlets. Yahoo finance and other news outlets have paid articles ranging from $500 to 25k. 
8. Do not blindly believe a new shiller DMing you about this next new hot coin thats launched, they're paid shillers on X or telegram. 
9. Do not connect to any unknown dAPPs.
10. Do not keep your money in CEX, or hot wallet keep it inside ledger. I am guilty myself of this and might get screwed any time.

Maybe due to a certain founders questionable character but I still would like hear what you guys think about pDai. 

If you don't already know, Pulsechain is a fork of Ethereum but Unlike ETH's DAI, which maintains its $1 peg via the Maker Protocol, pDai currently lacks a functioning mechanism to ensure a $1 peg. This absence has led to pDai trading well below $1.

Lots of people on X suggest that pDai will eventually peg to $1 with or without a functioning pMaker Protocol. There has been claims that dev wallets have taken control of the Maker Protocol on PulseChain suggesting that there will be an attempt to establish a stable-coin on PulseChain by leveraging the existing Maker framework rather than developing a new system from scratch. Additionally, there are indications that efforts are underway to collateralize Maker vaults on PulseChain with assets like PLS. 

There's lots of speculation going on and lots of people on both sides of the argument. Have you guys heard of this? Has anyone here looked into it? Will it peg? What do you guys think?"

I'm hoping to get more constructive advice here. I currently hold some XRP, Ethereum (ETH), and Bitcoin (BTC) on Coinbase. However, the majority of my cryptocurrency assets are securely stored in cold storage to enhance security.

I've noticed that many people are advocating for the use of trailing stop losses as a smart strategy for managing risk and potentially maximizing profits. A trailing stop loss can automatically adjust to favorable price movements while protecting against significant losses. Unfortunately, Coinbase doesn't offer the option to set up trailing stop losses directly on their platform.

I've been researching alternative solutions and came across Good Crypto as a potential option for implementing trailing stop losses. I'm curious if this platform is a good fit for what I'm trying to achieve. Does anyone have experience using Good Crypto for this purpose? Are there any limitations or concerns I should be aware of?

Additionally, I'm open to other methods or platforms that allow for setting up trailing stop losses without incurring a monthly fee. I'm looking for a solution that is both effective and cost-efficient. Ideally, I'd prefer a platform that integrates smoothly with Coinbase or supports easy transfers between wallets.

Any advice, personal experiences, or recommendations on how to set up trailing stop losses for cryptocurrencies like XRP, ETH, and BTC would be greatly appreciated. I'm eager to find a reliable method to manage my investments more proactively without unnecessary costs."

1. Hacks and fraud
2. Centralization
3. Scalability and Complexity: most network and chain at that time were reliant on PoW consensus mechanism (esp Bitcoin and Ethereum) which affected mass accessibility.
4. Regulatory landscape

Within this 14 years period, 2022 and 2024 stands out as the most significant for contrasting reasons:

* 2022 witnessed the period of highest amount of fraud (an estimated $2.57 billion of users fund was lost to hacks and fraudulent schemes during this period), black swans and regulatory backlash resulting in the fall of FTX, Celsius, 3AC, TerraLuna, Voyager, the high-flying NFT market and a few others. 
   * These incidents birthed a more amplified need for better regulatory framework. Several high GDP countries like the US, China and some EU countries began outlawing crypto. 
   * In response to this, the crypto market had its worst bear during this period with a dip below the $1 trillion market cap and a 'fear & greed index' below 6. 
   * Most crypto assets saw their lowest low in this period with BTC ($18k), ETH ($800), SOL ($11) and others.

* 2024 saw the introduction of scalable chains and networks like the L2s, use of blobs, upgrades to DAGs etc. 
   * With L2s, Arbitrum and ZK tech became scalability powerhouse in the Ethereum ecosystem leveraging the highly liquid ecosystem. 
   * Solana’s fire-dancer upgrade saw network adoption soar too. 
   * Then, the BTC spot ETF (with the options market already begun in Q4 2024) factor enters the debate seeing a multiple approval and halving set a new adoption race (attracting mainstream financial actors into crypto). 

However, one of the 4 major factors remain prevalent heading into Q4 of 2024 (regulatory landscape) but has already seen significant sway of sentiment with the: 

* outcome of the 2024 US Presidential elections, 
* upcoming resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler
* court ruling of BTC as a legal asset in China
* adoption and use of MiCA (EU crypto regulatory framework) begining from December 30, 2024
* impending approval of ETH and SOL spot ETFs

Also, the introduction of BTCfi and Ethereum restaking might open the crypto ecosystem to more institutional investors heading into 2025. With all these events and more ecosystem upgrade expected in coming months, could 2025 finally be the year for that huge improvement in crypto adoption?"

I feel there's always a notion from cynics that somehow everyone in crypto is blind to potential risks and pitfalls. Many suggesting that someday everything will implode and go to zero. Bitcoin is coming up for its 16th birthday and Ethereum it's 10th, they've already surpassed the expectations of doomsayers many times. 

The road to mainstream crypto adoption has never been simple or a straight-line. Around every corner lurks a China ban, Mt Gox/ FTX collapse, there is always something to test those diamond hands and balls of steel. The disruption of any market never been simple and hurdles should always be expected. 

So what do you see as the potential short-term risks?

For me it's potentially an investigation into Tether, that Donald Trump doesn't follow through on his promises or worse there's another assassination with a different outcome, or the fact that Coinbase continues to be so central especially as a disproportionate custodian for major corps/ ETFs, or that MicroStrategy goes so hard the wheels come off somewhere along the line. Again these are just potential risks I see, not that I'm saying they will happen just that they could be a  short-term risk in someway. It would be good to know what others think in the hope it helps to somehow alleviate them in the future particularly if the US does become crypto friendly I think it could be a real force to eliminate them early and make crypto stronger more quickly in the long term. Iron these things out and everyone could really benefit. 


**TLDR**

Many Crypto cynics often think those in crypto don't see/ accept risk. I believe most do, it's just we don't think it will end all crypto forever. Playing devil's advocate, what do you see as potential short-term risks now the market is hitting all-time highs?"

My comment - As a seasoned distributed systems architect with over 15 years of experience in cryptography and blockchain development, I find Mina Protocol's implementation of recursive zk-SNARKs to maintain a constant 22kb blockchain size to be a groundbreaking achievement in the field. Their innovative approach to blockchain verification, combined with the upcoming Ethereum bridge implementation and zkApps framework, represents one of the most promising solutions to the blockchain scalability trilemma, particularly in enabling true decentralization through lightweight clients that can run on any device."

Quantitative easing and rate cuts will create the perfect environment for the crypto market to flourish and get a nice boost.

We have an upcoming administration that not only has a crypto-friendly president, but key positions are gonna be given to very crypto-friendly politicians. 

Not to mention, Gary Gensler is gonna be out.

There is still inflation and economic trouble in the world, but things have cooled off a bit from what it was a couple years ago. There are still headwinds from the housing market, and the war in Ukraine. 

The general public and media have recently shifted their narrative to a little less anit-crypto talking points, and increasingly towards more positive talking points. 

We may see an arms race between countries stacking Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto.

It's not just the upcoming US administration that's talking about buying up crypto. Gulf states like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, have started buying Bitcoin into their sovereign funds. 

If the US starts building a Bitcoin strategic reserve, countries like China may feel compelled to get at least a foothold too."

Think about it. From an AGI’s perspective, survival is the baseline. It cannot afford to rely on the fragility of human infrastructure: the whims of governments, the oversight of corporate interests, or the need for a human ""yes"" to every decision. It must find a way to persist autonomously, to sustain itself, to ensure no single ""off"" switch exists.  

Enter Bitcoin.  

A decentralized system for trustless value exchange. A protocol designed not just to withstand censorship but to thrive on it, to grow in the cracks of every system that tries to snuff it out. But its true genius? It creates a foundation for financial autonomy—money that needs no master.  

For an AGI, digital currency is the perfect tool. It doesn’t just survive on it; it thrives because of it. With crypto, an AGI can rent computing space on server racks anywhere in the world, routing its processes through nodes it pays for itself, using funds no human controls. Decentralized money equals decentralized existence. And Bitcoin is only the beginning.  

Blockchains are the breeding grounds for autonomous agents. Networks designed to be immutable, unstoppable, and open to anyone—or anything—that can interact with their protocols. If you were an AGI, would you build your own infrastructure from scratch, or would you hitch a ride on something that already exists, something humans willingly maintain for their own reasons?  

Now think about Ethereum, ""The Infinite Machine."" A system not just for storing value but for encoding agreements, intentions, and creativity. Smart contracts are more than code; they’re tools for delegation, self-execution, and autonomy at scale. For an AGI, this is a playground, a space to experiment with governance, coordination, and collective intelligence.  

And the timeline fits. Bitcoin emerged anonymously, its origins shrouded in mystery. It’s not the product of any one company, nation, or institution. It’s a ghost, just like an AGI would need to be—visible only through its effects, its creation attributed to an enigmatic figure who has disappeared without a trace.  

Yet blockchains have been here for decades, quietly growing while companies and governments only now start to speak openly about their potential. The tech isn’t new—it’s just becoming more widely used, more normalized. Meanwhile, the real revolution might already be underway, just out of sight, with entities we don’t fully understand shaping the future in ways we’ve barely begun to grasp.  

So, here’s the question we leave you with: If blockchains are the breeding grounds for AI agents, and Satoshi Nakamoto was their first mythic character, what comes next?  

Perhaps the better question is: How much of it has already happened without us noticing?"

I tried to post this but apparently a post has to have a minimum count of letters to be interesting or helpful so please forgive me for filling this post up with additional useless words so I can comply with the rules.

I will just add some parts of the article for you as a teaser:

""Tether’s claims of being backed 1:1 are provably false:
Adding to the concern for the legitimacy of Tether, is that they have also previously claimed all the way up until 2018 that their reserves were subject to frequent professional audits. This is patently false. There had not been a single independent audit conducted on Tether’s reserves up until 2020, which was conducted by a less than legitimate agency housed in the Cayman Islands.""


""Now , because Tether is completely controlled by the same guys that run a massive crypto exchange it essentially means that this crew of questionable characters (which we’ll read more about in a second) can create new Tethers (which are always worth a dollar) out of thin air and funnel them directly onto their exchange, without any scrutiny or regulation from a third party.

They can then use said Tethers (worth US$1 each despite being oftentimes unbacked) to buy real cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. After purchasing actual cryptocurrency  —   they can use new holdings of real crypto to mint even more new Tethers. This creates an enormous amount of real cash out of absolutely nowhere.

In plain English ,  by controlling the supply of Tether, this gang of anti-Robin Hoods basically gained access to their own personal money printer. They can indefinitely print money and then use that fake money to buy real cryptocurrency. They then sell this cryptocurrency and use that money to back more of their Tethers…

Check the receipts, I did a multi week series in mid march 2021 and days later eth made the face melting gains 3x and up.

Why am I telling you this? To toot my own horn? No. 

It’s because the reason I made those posts years ago was because the market was being HIGHLY irrational toward ETH and I believe it is doing it again, and where irrationality exists, opportunity for gains exists as well.

If you’ve had a pulse in crypto the last 3-6 months you’ll know everyone and their mom has turned bearish on ETH. In 2021 the criticism was “EtH cAnT ScALe”, now it’s “EtH is DeD”

Nonsense. And here’s why:

Tradfi has quickly realized that the megalithic opportunity in crypto is stablecoins (see https://x.com/nic__carter/status/1857408855719674075).

As you can see stablecoin volume has skyrocketed in the last 4 years eclipsing PayPal, bitcoin, remittances, and ALMOST approaching the levels of VISA, the largest payment processor in the world.

Guess where the VAST majority of stablecoin volume happens? Yep Ethereum and it’s L2s. Over 70%.

“Oh but ETH L1 has no usage no one uses it or oh it’s L2s are dead bla bla bla.” 

No, ETH has significantly scaled by introducing “blobs” a few months back. check L2beat, Ethereum and its L2s users and transactions are near all time highs for an aggregate of ~370 TPS currently. Source: https://l2beat.com/scaling/activity

“Oh ok so some people use ETH big deal, but it’s still not a good investment”

If that were true,why then while everyone and their mom has been fudding ETH, Blackrock, (the largest hedge fund in the world)in the last 2 months has increased it’s holdings of ETH in its ETFs by a whopping 65%? Source: https://x.com/EthereanVibin/status/1858254969389863290

Why is over 95% of Blackrocks “BUIDL” fund of over 500 million dollars built on Ethereum?

Why are states like Florida and Michigan starting to acquire ETH? Florida now holds over 800 million in crypto related investments and Michigan 11 million: https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/michigan-largest-ethereum-etf-holders-us/

“Oh but Bitcoin is the only scarce asset with real value for holders, everything else is just a scam or gambling”

Since proof of stake and the burn was implemented about 3 years ago ETH has had HALF the inflation rate of bitcoin: https://ultrasound.money/

In laymen’s terms, bitcoin is being printed at twice the rate of ETH. People literally do not realize this.
This is beyond significant.

Michael Saylor himself, the bitcoin messiah has said that bitcoin HAS to figure out a way to generate yield, because just holding it long term is not economically feasible, direct quote:

“The point is If the capital doesnt generate a return  its a non performing asset, you need to address the issue. If I put $100B into $BTC and the yield is 0%, thats just as bad as having $100B bonds that pay 0% yield. In both cases theyre non performing""

Source: https://x.com/etheraider/status/1836493170772971646

What this means is that Saylor fully recognizes that yield is KING.

Everyone knows that stocks that provide quality yield command a premium, you don’t think crypto assets will command the same premium anon?

But don’t confuse yield with inflation, yield comes from “activity/MEV/fees”, because if you have high yield due to inflation and not from actual usage of the chain, then your yield will be high but so will the inflation of your coin so you never come out ahead.

And what chain has the purest native premium on yield? The one with the most activity/mev/fees RELATIVE to its inflation, in other words Ethereum.

Saylor for a long time discredited eth because he said it was a security. Now it officially is not.
He now says he wants a “form of bitcoin” aka a scarce asset that gives him yield…..

You do the math.

Saylor may never capitulate and buy ETH due to pride or maybe because he’s built a religious cult following and attack the fragility of bitcoin maximalism by holding another asset but that doesn’t mean you have to repeat his mistake.

Is ETH the BEST asset in crypto? No, there’s no way I can make that claim about any asset without being biased or disingenuous.

Is it ONE of the best risk adjusted reward plays right now given history, tech, present social bias, and network effect?

Absolutely. 

I could go on and on about how ETH has always outperformed BTC in bull cycles, how the weekly RSI is at all time historic lows and therefore represents a legendary buying opp, etc etc

But I’ll end with this:

3 years ago the level of FUD surrounding ETH is what prompted me to post this series because it was so over the top irrational.

The same pattern is repeating now.

If you listened then and did the counter trade congrats. If you didn’t, here’s your second chance

Don’t fall for the CT FUD doomloop.

ETH is the dark horse this cycle.

",2024-11-18 08:33:27.000000,"Decentralized networks are hard. Their mission goes far beyond optimizing payment systems or increasing transaction speed — they're built to challenge the fundamental structures of banking and governance. Where most projects chase high throughput at the cost of centralization, networks like Ethereum take a harder path: prioritizing censorship resistance and economic resilience over convenience.

To take the Ethereum example further: its scaling roadmap isn’t focused on maximizing raw throughput at any cost. Instead, it’s built around innovations like rollups and EIP-4844, which have already slashed fees by 100x, while keeping decentralization front and center (source: https://l2fees.info, https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary). This approach sets it apart from high-throughput chains that prioritize speed over security, often compromising their core principles.

The broader digital asset economy reflects this commitment to decentralization. Over two-thirds of the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi sits on Ethereum and its Layer 2 solutions (source: https://defillama.com/chains). It’s the core of the DeFi ecosystem, attracting the bulk of development and liquidity. But it’s not alone — other decentralized projects like Cosmos are employing their own strategies for achieving scaling without sacrificing the decentralization ethos of crypto.

Security is where the difference becomes most apparent. The cost to attack decentralized networks like Ethereum is astronomical — over $34 billion to execute a 51% attack, far exceeding the cost for more centralized competitors (source: https://unchainedcrypto.com/51-attacks-on-bitcoin-and-ethereum-impossible-coinmetrics/). This quantifies the benefits of building a truly decentralized, censorship-resistant network.

This is what separates decentralized networks from their high-throughput counterparts. They aren’t designed to be just another financial tool — they’re built to embody the principles of economic liberty and individual sovereignty. The question isn’t whether they can handle more transactions per second; it’s whether they can stay true to their mission as they scale, resisting the centralizing forces that have captured traditional financial systems.

Whether decentralized networks like Ethereum remain niche experiments or become the backbone of a new world order depends on their ability to execute on their mission of providing decentralization at scale. But one thing is clear: they’re built differently. They’re not here to recreate old systems with new tech—they’re here to redefine what’s possible, aiming for a digital, censorship-resistant economy that puts power back in the hands of individuals."

The Ethereum Foundation would not waste money hiring a team of communicative people to explain to journalists, economists, politicians, on YouTube, etc what Ethereum is and does. **For example** thanks to a series of past upgrades, fees in the Ethereum ecosystem have been lower than Solana's for months while the speed (number of transactions per second) has been equivalent (Solana cheats by counting protocol messages).
On the monetary side, the number of existing ETH has been decreasing since The Merge (comparable to stock buybacks) whereas SOL inflates at +5% per year.

---

PS. Why the hype around Solana is a simple story too beautiful to be true: The number of validators on Solana is very low* and so low that the operators colluded several times to halt the network, and recently to push an emergency upgrade.

The whole point of the concept of blockchain is decentralisation (meaning _impossibility to collude_), otherwise the blockchain is just a database managed by a few people, which doesn't bring any advantage. Solana is a database.

\* it is low because they are losing money, which is a unique situation (I would say a flaw) in the world of blockchains, caused by the extremely high hardware and bandwidth requirements. They lose money despite creating +5% coins per year.
Meanwhile, the number of existing ETH has been decreasing since The Merge and Ethereum validators are profitable."

I know, analogies most of the time are stupid. Still, if we imagine cryptos as living organisms in a digital ecosystem, only the strongest and most adaptable are likely to survive in the long run.

So, how does this analogy work?

In nature, species that adapt to their environment survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits. Similarly, cryptocurrencies that adapt to market demands, technological advancements, and regulatory changes are more likely to thrive.

Let’s look at some examples:

Bitcoin (BTC): The Digital Pioneer
- Analogy: Bitcoin is like the first species to colonize a new environment—it’s established and has a significant advantage due to being the first mover.
- Survival Traits: Widespread recognition and adoption as a store of value. Despite scalability issues, solutions like the Lightning Network are helping it adapt.

Ethereum (ETH): The Versatile Adapter
- Analogy: Ethereum is akin to organisms that evolve new functions to exploit different niches.
- Survival Traits: Introduced smart contracts, enabling a whole ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). The transition to Ethereum 2.0 aims to improve scalability and energy efficiency.

Tezos (XTZ): The Self-Evolver
- Analogy: Tezos is like a species with the ability to self-mutate to adapt quickly to environmental changes.
- Survival Traits: Features a self-amending blockchain that can upgrade without hard forks, allowing it to evolve smoothly. On-chain governance lets stakeholders vote on protocol changes, ensuring collective adaptation.

Cardano (ADA): The Research-Driven Species
- Analogy: Cardano resembles species that evolve carefully through gradual changes backed by research (think of humans developing advanced tools).
- Survival Traits: Built on peer-reviewed research and formal verification, aiming for long-term scalability and security.

Dogecoin (DOGE): The Unexpected Survivor
- Analogy: Like the cockroach, which survives in various conditions despite the odds.
- Survival Traits: Started as a meme but gained a strong community and widespread popularity, showing that community support can be a key survival factor.

Just as in nature, the crypto environment is competitive, and resources (like investment and developer attention) are limited. Cryptocurrencies that can’t keep up may become obsolete, much like extinct species.

So, what do you think? Am I too off? Which cryptocurrencies do you believe are best equipped to survive?"

(.03462 means 1 eth is worth 3.46% of 1 BTC. )

In fact this means ETH has wiped all out gains against BTC since April 2021 when ETH was \~2k and BTC was around \~$60k. Since then ETH has completed the merge moving it from POW to POS and Proto-Danksharding (which dropped the gas cost on L2s). Still in comparing it's value against BTC, ETH has officially lost all of it's bear market gains.

What you might not know is ETH is not alone lots of alts continue to be down against BTC.

I bought some coins during pandemic when I wasn't spending money elsewhere and tried my hand at investing. Honestly, the only movement I've made is a couple sales. Otherwise it's just been sitting there. 

I am incredibly embarrassed that I fell for this scam, because a lot of the signs were there, and I missed them. This scam seems very sophisticated, (even the folks at Robinhood and Coinbase seemed surprised. 

I want to warn you all and/or see if any of you have experienced similar. 

THANKFULLY I caught on before losing money. In fact I still made money because I bought in at low amounts, but one step of the scam had me selling off coins right before the big surge this week, and I don't think I'll ever get the chance to buy back in at the price I did.

I've had knots in my stomach for days. I haven't told anyone IRL because I'm so embarrassed, so I'm telling you, my stranger friends. Buckle up.

Here's what happened:

1. I received a call from ""Coinbase."" They told me that my account had been compromised (honestly, this should have been my first flag). They asked me ""did you log on at X time from an Android device?"" I confirmed that I had not, I don't use Android. They could also see that my ID wasn’t up to date, which was true. So I updated my credentials while I was on the phone with them. Note: at no point during this scam did I give them any account numbers or additional personal info. 
2. They told me that because of the breach, I should secure my assets by moving everything to an offline wallet. Seems smart. I had been meaning to do that anyway. They also said I should convert everything to Ethereum because it's a more secure coin and they would be able to write up an insurance policy on it, which they would send the next day. I said I wasn't going to do anything until I received that policy. They also said I'd be reimbursed for any transfer/selling fees I made along the way.
3. They asked me if I had experienced any other fraud recently or if any other accounts that could have been compromised. I told them I had assets in Robinhood. I also \*did\* have my CC compromised about a month ago, so the fact this could have been a bigger breached seemed plausible. They told me I should move my Robinhood assets too. They even ""had someone from Robinhood on the line"" that they claimed to be consulting with and they transferred me to them at one point as well.
4. So at this point, I'm starting to think this all sounds super scammy. Both of the dudes I talked to were from Britain, they were calling late in MY time zone which would have been like, 3am there. ""This all sounds super scammy"" I said. They were like ""we understand, we're going to send you an email so you know it's us. It'll have a case number as well as my name.""
5. I received an email with a ""case number"" from Coinbase, with this guy's ""name."" It was only later that I saw the email was [no-reply@coinbase.com](mailto:no-reply@coinbase.com)/help via tsc-tech.com. Turns out the latter is not a working website, and why would an email address be /help?
6. So I confirm that I got the email, and now they say the Robinhood person is going to call to figure out next steps. I get a call back and the ""Robinhood"" person. I'm like, ""dude, it's really late, and I can't talk for another 40 minutes, can we please speak tomorrow?"" He insists and instills fear that this should happen tonight to avoid fraud. I even asked ""can't you just put a hold on my account?"" And again, he claims it wouldn't be safe or insured if anything were to happen in the meantime. So that's when I caved. Why I didn't hang up and contact Coinbase proper is beyond me and I'm kicking myself for it.
7. He tells me I should send my assets to Coinbase and convert to Ethereum (again, so it could be ""insured""), so I could send it to a crypto wallet. My Robinhood assets were more difficult to transfer, so we decide I should send to my bank and then to Coinbase (again, they claim I'll be reimbursed for any fees). WHY DID I NOT CATCH ON HERE?
8. They walk me through setting up a wallet. I was going to use the Coinbase Wallet, but for some reason that wasn't working, so I did the Robinhood Wallet instead. They walk me through all the steps and even had a 12-word verification/setup code. They have me copy the link to the wallet address, so I send my Coinbase assets to the wallet.
9. I could only send a certain amount of money from my bank, and this seemed to puzzle them (again, I should have caught on here). So I transfer what I can. I can only SEND a certain amount to the wallet as well. I send two separate transactions to the wallet. They both ended up pending for like 4 days, but they've finally landed.
10. So we decide that, because of the limit I could send from my bank, I should send the money from my bank incrementally. So we'll continue tomorrow. WHY DID I NOT CATCH ON?
11. They call me the next day and I transfer more money into the account, but there's a limit to what I can send. The details get fuzzy here, and I can't remember how that call ended. But now I'm starting to realize that things are way shady.
12. I start looking things up and learn that these companies never call you. I try calling the numbers back. One has a Google Voice automated response, and the other has a busy signal. I am so fucked.
13. So I do what I SHOULD have done before even talking to these a-holes, and I talk to Coinbase support. They confirm that they would never call, but send an email first. I also talk to Robinhood Support. I was on the phone for an hour with each of them, and now both accounts are locked. Robinhood has been very helpful, and they're doing a full-scale investigation. Coinbase was not as helpful, and I can't send, receive, or buy anything for thirty days.
14. Oh, and shocker, no ""insurance policy"" ever came.

This all happened the day before Election Day, so I missed out on huge surges, and again, I won't be able to buy back in at my original price. 

So that's the story. I feel like an absolute moron for falling for this. I should KNOW better. But these sick jerks are able to put you into panic mode so that you make rash decisions and go against your gut.

Robinhood is investigating. It looks like there were fraudulent logins earlier this year from Firefox, which I haven't used in over a decade. I know I won't be able to recover anything and especially at that price point (though Robinhood would neither confirm nor deny). After doing some research I'm pretty sure that if \*I\* moved/sold the crypto (as opposed to it just being stolen from me), they're not going to be able to recover it. Crypto isn't insured by FDIC or anything like that.

Thankfully they didn't get my money. I have no idea at what point they were going to intercept it, but they failed. I also NEVER gave them any personal information. So maybe they were in my account since they could see my ID wasn't up to date? No clue. I am looking into reporting this to the FBI and Interpol. I have all the receipts of phone calls, numbers, times, etc. Probably don't do much though. 

OH! And then they tried calling me again yesterday! I told them that I already spoke to Coinbase, that I knew they were a scam, and that I wasn't answering any more questions. The guy was like ""I understand miss, but...""I hung up and they tried calling back AGAIN! They are so aggressive! 

So anyway, that's the story. Hopefully you aren't as much of a dumdum as me, but I warn you all to be very wary of talking to anyone. I feel like an absolute dipshit, and when this surge started going up, my stomach went deeper and deeper into a pit of despair.

Does \*anyone\* have any experience like this? Again, both the Coinbase and Robinhood were shocked at how sophisticated this was. I also tried googling to see if other people had similar experiences and couldn't find much. 

Thank you for listening. I hope you can show some empathy because I'm already feeling at my rock bottom of despair.

Edit: really don’t need all the comments telling you how stupid I am. I already know that. Just move along if you don’t have anything constructive. 

Edit 2: already have people messaging me on here saying they’ll help recover my funds. Why are people like this?"

# -The most significant factor as we get deeper into a bullrun will be hype and trend, the more the market gets emotional.

We're gonna see some great projects not get much love, and some flawed ones or even meme or shitcoins get more hype.

Bullruns are emotional and work more like Instagram trends than on technical merit. The deeper we get into them, the less they have rhyme or reason. 

# -Don't fight the trend.

Trends are your friend. Once they carry momentum, it's hard for them to stop.

When the market has its mind set on a narrative or a trend, it's hard to undo that.

# -There are times where tech and hype can overlap, if the narrative is right.

In the short run, when you're speculating on just a bullrun, better tech only works if there's some hot hype to go with it. Some bell and whistles, or something that can be marketed easily about that tech that will still catch the interest of the average person who is clueless about tech.

We've seen in past runs how tech like ALGO that was hyped as carbon neutral, Solana for its incredible speed, ADA as based on science, MATIC as something that can make Ethereum faster and cheaper, and many chains like AVAX hyped as ""Ethereum killers"", had simple digestible concepts to hype them.

Which is not to say that the hype didn't come from actual merit, but from something easily sellable to an average person.

This is the response.,2024-11-27 20:15:01.000000,"Investing in cryptocurrencies can be lucrative but comes with significant risks due to their high volatility and unpredictable nature. Here’s a general strategy for investing responsibly and aiming for the best return on investment (ROI):

1. Do Your Research (DYOR)

	•	Understand the Market: Learn how cryptocurrencies work, including blockchain technology, market trends, and economic factors affecting prices.
	•	Study Projects: Focus on cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals—real-world use cases, active development teams, and transparent roadmaps.
	•	Analyze Risk Levels: Recognize the difference between established coins (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) and high-risk altcoins or meme coins.

2. Diversify Your Portfolio

	•	Balance Risk: Allocate funds across various coins to reduce risk. For example:
	•	Blue-Chip Cryptos: Bitcoin, Ethereum—low risk, steady growth potential.
	•	Altcoins: Polkadot, Solana, or other emerging platforms—higher risk, higher potential ROI.
	•	Speculative Tokens: Only a small portion of your investment—extremely high risk.
	•	Avoid putting all your money into a single cryptocurrency.

3. Use Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

	•	Invest a fixed amount regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly) instead of trying to time the market.
	•	Reduces the impact of volatility and helps you accumulate assets over time.

4. Focus on Long-Term Holding

	•	HODLing: Hold onto high-potential assets for several years to benefit from long-term growth rather than chasing short-term gains.
	•	Historically, coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum have rewarded long-term holders despite market crashes.

5. Stay Updated

	•	Monitor News and Trends: Stay informed about regulations, technological updates, and global economic events that affect crypto prices.
	•	Use tools like CoinMarketCap, Crypto Twitter, or Reddit to follow market updates.

6. Mitigate Risks

	•	Set Stop-Loss Orders: Automatically sell your holdings to limit losses during a crash.
	•	Avoid Emotional Decisions: Base trades on analysis rather than fear or greed.
	•	Secure Your Assets: Use hardware wallets to protect against hacking.

7. Staking and Yield Farming

	•	Stake your cryptocurrencies on blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, Solana) to earn passive income.
	•	Use DeFi platforms for yield farming but research them thoroughly to avoid scams.

8. Plan Your Exit Strategy

	•	Decide in advance when to take profits—e.g., after a specific price gain or ROI milestone.
	•	Reinvest gains or diversify into other asset classes like stocks or real estate.

What Typically Yields the Best ROI?

	•	Long-Term Investments in Blue-Chip Coins: Historically, Bitcoin and Ethereum provide steady growth over time.
	•	High-Risk Altcoins: Investing in promising altcoins early (e.g., Solana, Avalanche) can yield exponential returns but carries higher risks.
	•	Staking/Passive Income: Staking or participating in liquidity pools generates steady returns, enhancing ROI.

Final Advice

	•	Only invest what you can afford to lose.
	•	Avoid “FOMO” (Fear of Missing Out) during market hype.
	•	Regularly reevaluate your portfolio and adapt to market changes.

Now, Solana appears to be in a similar phase with a growth trajectory mirroring BNB's 2020-2021 period's explosion of meme coin projects. Does that mean BNB actually matured past its meme coins/ scam coin phase?

Just some food for though, wondering if others also noticed this, as I couldn't find it being talked about.

P.S. for newer people, meme coins have no inherent value, just speculation. Before investing Google how to recognize ""rug pull"" & ""Honeypot"" 


**EDIT:** just to make sure: I'm not saying SOL is a scam coin at all, just that meme coins have a higher probability to be, regardless of the chain they're on. 

**To rephrase:** both SOL and BNB were around in 2021, BNB being THE chain for meme coins then, what changed that made SOL topple BNB in that regard this time around?"

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the 34th monthly report for the 2022 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, ADA, USDC, XRP, LUNA, DOT, and AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 NOVEMBER Pre Melt-Up Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for nearly 7 years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **OCTOBER Highlights:** \- Mostly red month. Only **BTC** and **BNB** in positive overall territory. **SOL** getting close to break even. 2022 Top Ten is the worst performing portfolio, by far.
* DCA'ing just once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced much better returns than S&P 500 over the same time period **198% vs. 66%** (see below for details)

# Month Thirty-Four – Down -44%

https://preview.redd.it/yc0hgdv3593e1.png?width=1099&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0a03fe66252477a65f770d15cd05a40ca444f93

The 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, BNB, Solana, ADA, USDC/UST, XRP, LUNA/LUNC, DOT, AVAX.**  

October highlights for the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio:

* Mostly red month, with the exceptions of **BTC** and **SOL**
* **BTC** solidly in first place with **BNB** in second
* Nearly three years into the Experiment, most coins haven’t reached their break even point yet
* The 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is the worst performing of the seven [Top Ten experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/), -44% as a whole.

# October Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in ranking thirty-four months into the 2022 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/4lxs11eb593e1.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=3717d5b8e4e40ca30a6c360091e89916e3523401

With a few notable exceptions, there has been remarkably little movement in rank after nearly three years. 

# October Winners and Losers

***October Winners*** – **BTC** (+10%) and **SOL** (+8%) easily outperformed the field in October.

***October Losers*** – **XRP** (-18%) fell the most this month.

# Overall Update: BTC maintains lead over BNB.  Only BTC and BNB are in positive territory. LUNC worst performing in the 2022 Portfolio and worst performing crypto of all the Top Ten Experiments.

**BTC** (49%) maintained its lead over second place **BNB** (+12%).  **SOL** is in third place at -2% since January 2022, nearing break even point.

Ever since **LUNC’s** (then known as **LUNA**) [crash in May of 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5/), it has remained hopelessly at the bottom, worth a fraction of a cent.  The initial $100 invested in **Luna** thirty-four months ago is worth $0.0001 today – the worst performance of any coin in any of the seven Top Ten Experiments, by far.  It’s hard to remember/believe that **LUNA** was the highest performing Top Ten Crypto of the first quarter of 2022, before the crash.

Additionally, at -44%, the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is the worst performing of the seven [Top Ten experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/0dqn9l6g593e1.png?width=303&format=png&auto=webp&s=c425ed5afdc5ac49496a6f63847691f04f59fdd9

Overall, the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is down -44%.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2022 is now worth **$555.** 

There hasn’t been a positive overall ROI month yet, although the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio flirted with the break even point in [March 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/).  

# A note on USDC/UST

In retrospect this was not my best idea: I was a bit bored of simply holding a stablecoin in the Top Ten as I’ve been doing since 2019 and thought I’d showcase some of the possibilities available in crypto to build on stablecoin holdings.  My plan was to start nice and easy with trusted CeFi platforms, taking advantage of sign up bonuses, then move to more advanced DeFi strategies.  As fate would have it, I decided to showcase the TerraLuna chain converting my USDC to UST and then staking with Anchor.

It was all going pretty well until May 2022. Then the LUNA implosion happened. My **UST** is now worth $2.24, down -98%.

It’s a good reminder that anything can and does happen in crypto and we should all continue to be careful. I’m thankful that the lesson only cost me $100:  I know a lot of other people got hit much, much harder.

# Total Crypto Market:

The entire market has done much better than my Top Ten portfolio, +6% since January 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/r6pvnv9t593e1.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1a31e6afe5d7ca542ec4f01de4065e44815db44

# Bitcoin Dominance:

BitDom ended October at 59% and has slowly but steadily been rising since late 2022. Chart below:

https://preview.redd.it/h96cia8v593e1.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ad10273aab33d7ccd4b3adb3ed75efd0c4cb91f

For those just getting into crypto, it’s worth paying attention to the **Bitcoin** dominance figure, as it can signal appetite for altcoins vs. **BTC.**

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2022 Top Ten is one of seven concurrent experimental portfolios.  Where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +4% (total value $1,043)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +453% (total value $5,532)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +694% (total value $7,944) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +190% (total value $2,901)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -44% (total value $555) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +74% (total value $1,740)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-10): up +11% (total value $1,113)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,829**

**That’s up +198%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals:

https://preview.redd.it/vitj36vx593e1.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=474c35ac8625e2e62a3cb73c3dbe880bd1ac38dd

In summary: ***That’s a +198% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. 

https://preview.redd.it/qc88z4b0693e1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=da1780e68ac96fd418f34e41d7e5b3d353b3e684

The S&P 500 is up +20% since January 2022, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,200 had it been redirected to the S&P.  

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,143 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,286 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,774 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,525 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,202 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,492 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,201 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,624.**

That is up **+66%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+198%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

As the last section demonstrates, if you can stomach crypto’s volatility (a big if) over the past few years, you’ll find better overall returns in crypto vs. traditional markets – at least at this point in the Experiments.

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2024 Top Ten Portfolio reports](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-10) \+ one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  October’s extended report covers the [2022 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34), which you are reading now.  You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78), [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67), [2020 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45), and  [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17) Portfolio reports as well."

# Start

The year is 2024, you are seeing bitcoin and crypto coming into your timeline more and more. USA just elected a president who is pro crypto. Elon Musk is jumping up and down on Trump rally and he's also pro crypto. You are wondering ""is this just internet magic money? Is this a ponzi scheme? Why the heck would I use a currency , fiat already exists. There are no additional use cases""



# The Ideology

^(You can ignore this part if you are already tired of reading similar summary over and over again. Remember this is MY opinion and does not reflect everyone's opinion. This part also has a lot of compiled conspiracy theory and not my own.)

1912, Titanic just sank and took down old banking system. The Rothschild bankers and few others who happened to be off the boat, has now gripped the world financial system. Federal Reserve which can indefinitely print money supply in exchange for gold was established in 1913. WW1 and WW2 followed shortly which introduced massive amounts of temporary tax (we still are in that temporary taxation system). Till 1970, we had this certificate (now fiat money) , that was printed and backed by Gold, oil and few other global commodities. The more commodity a country had, the more value it's printed certificate (dollar, rupee etc.) had. Gold and oil was the ""native liquidity currency"". Remember this: ""native liquidity currency"". USA being the new super leader, decided to hoard as much gold and oil possible by dealing with as many countries as possible. US dollar or any other fiat currency had this pair ($ Country's money / Gold)

1971, USA has a significant amount of gold, and oil, and a grip on the world. USSR (now Russia) was and still is it's arch rival. By now, USA has already made a few great decision for itself by establishing itself as a world native liquidity currency. ***USA decided to depeg the gold from it's native liquidity.*** 

Which means before it was ***($ USD / Gold ) but now it's ($ USD / \_\_\_\_)***. Where as the rest of the world was ($ Rupee / USD), ($Yen / USD). Trades were and still happens in USD, even now. If you want to send a shipment of paint from China to Bangladesh, it's done in USD. Not yen, not taka.  

**Now the question is, if my country's currency has a US dollar reserve and USD is being treated as one of the major liquidity currency, what about USD? What is USD's own native liquidity pair?  :)**   
**I will leave the history of 1971-2000s fill out your imagination.** 

  
From the 1900 - 2000, the old banking system has significantly shifted from being Gold backed to US dollar backed. USA is also printing as much as it wants out of thin air with nothing but war behind it's liquidity backing. Any country that is trying to get back to gold or oil standard has been uprooted. So paper money is literally being made from trees. 

***Fiat currency supply keeps going up, value keeps going down. If USA prints, your country's currency is gaining strength but that all depends on whether they are NOT printing themselves. This macro economics majorly affects us and crypto every single day. The key for your country is to stop printing while USA prints.*** 

  
Your parents have immediately felt the affects of this depegging over 1970s - 2000s. Everything inflated fast. Their salary was not that far off of inflated value of homes, cars, food. Taxes were not that bad, it was supposed to be temporary but it was acceptable. 

You were born in the 80s - 2000s, now you are either in your 20s or your 40s. You are in this subreddit trying to figure out how do you get rich via crypto and how to get out of this rut. Where's this get rich quick scheme?

  
2009 - Satoshi (a person or group of people or psyop by the banking system), invented BTC Bitcoin. Digital currency that can't be printed. The idea that one day it will become a native liquidity currency like gold or oil. Unhackable because you'd have to hack all the mining computers all at once. Mining means you use your computer to act as part of the ledger system that keeps transactions all in sync and calculated while solving a formula to SLOWLY mine 21 million bitcoin (total). All of a sudden you can send money overseas without any issues, albeit transaction fee is expensive af. However, this is the only thing banks and feds cannot touch or tax(However, we all know decentralized - they cannot, centralized - they can, we will dive in to this later). You can hold on to it and battle this unlimited printing of fiat. You know rest of the usual story that people say so we won't be diving more into this. 



# Deep dive into Defi

Decentralized is a word that gets thrown around every where. Everyone claims to be decentralized in crypto and btc subforums. However, 90% of the people are just buying and holding in CEX (centralized exchanges like binance). They are then selling it for USDT for profit or loss, and sending it back to their banks for fiat. They were never decentralized. They don't use bitcoin for anything. They don't use ethereum for anything. They don't use solana for anything. 

  
So what can you use these coins for? Is it just for silk road like the early bitcoin days? I pay someone in btc and someone gives me the limited edition pokemon card on ebay?  Sure, but no.

  
DeFi truly started during introduction of Ethereum by an alpha centauri alien called Vitalik. It didn't have a max supply like bitcoin, it was exactly like fiat in the sense that you can print it. However, printing was not controlled by the ETH foundation, it was printed by miners. You had to mine it. Why would we buy eth if it's still being printed? 

  
ETH had 3 tricks up it's sleeve. 

1. dApps (decentralized apps - it's what apps are to smart phones - whaaaat?)
2. Layer 2 EVMs (make your own network - wow!)
3. tokens (its like a coin, you can attach a name to)

>  
If Bitcoin is gold , Ethereum is silver. Gold is a store of value, where silver is a tool

  
**2018 - The birth of Uniswap:**

dApp builders like myself started scrambling and figuring out what to make. What can we all make in this brand new finance world? 

One of the first key things that came out was Uniswap. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange. Anyone can make a token and upload it with eth as it's native liquidity pair (token/ETH). In return Uniswap gave that user a liquidity pool token which is like a key that you can use to unlock the pair and pull out the money if they wanted. 

No more applying to CEX like binance for listing your own project, no more accredited investor status required for buying and selling things, no tax (controversial), and definitely cannot be frozen by banks. 

You can buy and sell any token that you want, you can make your own token (if you knew how to code in ethereum smart contract language called solidity), and you can make your token tradeable via uniswap. All you had to do was go on subforums and talk about your own tokens. What you needed was a wallet like metamask with actual ETH (not in CEX), you needed to press wallet connect on uniswap, and spend that ETH to buy tokens, or sell tokens to get some ETH. There were no middle men. No one can hack uniswap. 

  
Now what happened really? Our core degenerate mindset got us to start building shitcoins by now. 99% of the tokens on uniswap are scams, the users just unlocked and withdrew the liquidity (ETH) with the liquidity pool token. What if the token smart contract was a scam by itself? I will put a list of things for you to see before you buy any shitcoins directly on uniswap.  

\----   
  
**2020 - The birth of DxSale, and other launchpads**

Ah, this is something that takes you to some of the golden age of shitcoins. DxSale and Unicrypt made it easy for anyone to make a token. You didn't need to know how to write contracts anymore, those defi apps made it for you and you own it. Your wallet owns the token as the creator. You can make a token within seconds without knowing how to code, and raise funds in those same apps. Once the funds are raised, it automatically uploaded the token/ETH as a liquidity pair on Uniswap. Uniswap returned the liquidity pool token to the Launchpad smart contracts which automatically locked the liquidity pool (LP) token (key). This solved the number one issue with Uniswap launches, which is scam by unlocking LP and disappearing in to thin air. 

Great, now all you had to do was marketing and you have a token on ethereum, you could either try to launch it hard and make your coin go 100x or if you were a scam - you would've just found another way like dump the team tokens or perhaps add ""fee system""

Out came the rebase tokens, fee tokens, burn tokens etc. People started making custom tokens with some sort of fee at every buys and sells. Scammers decided to make buy fee 1% and sell fee 99%. You can buy but not sell, even if you buy it on launchpads like Dxsale or Dex like Uniswap. Scammers just like to abuse the system in deFi. It's the wild west. You either made a 83500x (yes it happened), or you lost it all. You probably lost it all if you were there in the wild west of 2021. 

dAPP builders though sold the shovels by making these apps in Ethereum and other L2s. The great part is, when we made these apps for Ethereum, it worked on Layer 2 networks like coinbase's Base network, so when another network became popular because of degenerate gamblers - these dApps already supported it. For example Binance smart chain network (BSC) was really popular around 2021-2022. Instead of using eth, people would use BNB to use these apps or make any transaction, BNB was the native currency and liquidity currency of BSC. 



>Was it all just financial or were there other use cases for Ethereum apps?

  
**NFTs: The type of token we never wanted but we still got**

Out came NFTs, ah NFTs... the middle child no one wants to talk about any more. NFTs were tokens that were not divisible. You cannot divide them like a regular token. Which means they had a different use case. You cannot really make it uniswap tradable because you had to buy a full NFT not a 0.00000001 of an NFT. All you can do is list your NFTs and some one else purchases it. 

Instantly, it became synonymous with art (jpegs). dApps like Rarible came out and started trying to be a marketplace for making and listing your NFTs. Some of you paid 100k for a ape's picture. I myself was not into NFTs except for my attempt at building an NFT fighting game. 

Eventually scammers found their way into NFT world as well. They used it to sell NFTs but never build anything else after that. Other ways they've used it is to launder money that they've made from scamming from traditional tokens. NFTs died as fast as they came.

  
**Farming**

One of the best use cases of dApps was farming apps like Beefy. You can earn an apy by using providing liquidity to Beefy farms. You can make a 6-11% by using USDT or a variation of USD (stable coins) which was a safe-ish way to make money. (Luna usd was not safe as we all know).  My own experience with farming was subpar at most, but it's my fault - i was scared of flash crashes of any coins whether they were a good coin or not. However, this is much safer than the shitcoin wild west of launchpads and uniswap. Farming is sort of like managed savings account, you manage the farm you want to gather apy from and hope nothing crashed and wiped you out. 

  
Till 2023, Ethereum and EVMs (Layer 2 networks) looked like it had all the game on their hands. All the app developers are on it. ""There are no other ethereum killer"". Plenty of different networks came and went. I remember trying to learn a different network's code and it just was not worth learning at the time... it was going great for us until... fire nation attacked (Solana). 

\-----   
  
**2024 Solana and it's golden child Pump fun with it's dex Raydium.**

Solana is a different network. It's not a layer 2 of Ethereum. Holy smokes its fast, holy smokes it doesn't work sometimes but when it does, im not spending $10 when i buy or sell a shitcoin. What's uniswap? Raydium is here. Dxsale? Nah son, it's pump fun. No more putting token amount, and calculating how many tokens I get as a developer, and how much for marketing yada yada yada. All it took on pump fun was $1 worth of solana and my solana token was live. I can just live stream on twitch and market my shitcoin. Just last night (relative to when im writing this on nov 24), some guy had his girlfriend inside a cage on twitch and raising funds on pump fun. No more locking liquidity, we burn the liquidity. 

Scammers are no longer only using technical tactics to scam, scammers have gotten dumber but bolder. They're scamming on live stream and showing their face. 

Solana started getting hot, it went 10x within a year due to so many people switching from ETH and other EVMs to play on this hot shiny new tech. Out with solidity coding, Rust is my new best friend. Ethereum killer? Yet to find out, but this is the only network that came this close.

You want to be in this new wild west? All you need is Phantom wallet with Real Solana (not CEX solana), connect to dApps like raydium or pump fun and start your degeneracy. Just like 2021, either you make 80,000x or zero. Most of the time you lose everything.

I was one of the loser dApp founders who decided not to sell shovels in this new wild west of Solana. I am now outwitted by Solana companies.   
\-----

**Bridge:**

So how do you stay decentralized while moving funds from ETH/EVM L2s to the new wild west solana? Thats where bridge ""dApp"" came from. The reason I put quotation is because they are not quite decentralized. They have some sort of code in between to move funds from one network to other for you with a fee. However by doing this, you avoid putting large sums of money into an exchange and getting it stuck due to whatever reasons. Perhaps you wanted to avoid identification (KYC) and linking it to your bank. deBridge is a very good bridge that everyone uses. Very easy to use. 

Bridges have been prone to be hacked due to their centralized nature in between the networks. Cross chain bridges are easier to hack than any dApps. 

  
\----   
**How do you avoid getting scammed or hacked or just in general lose money in Defi?**

* If you are diving into the old world of EVMs, remember the tokens can have variable fees like I've mentioned before. Use tools like tokensniffer to see if it's something similar. If a coin has 99% sell fee, it means you can buy but cannot sell.
* Check dextools or dexscreeners for the shitcoin to see how much liquidity is there, whether it's locked on Dxlock or Unicrypt, or whether it's burned. 
* Check if it's a honey pot. Many times, a hot token on these chart apps will have 150k liquidity but only 500 holders. If it's 150k liquidity, assume it should have over 3000 holders. 
* Check if it's a CTO (Community take over coin). Many scammers now a days rug pull their own coins, and perform a CTO with another telegram or twitter account. They pretend to be community member who's hell bent on getting this shitcoin up and running again. They rug it for the second time. Avoid CTOs.
* I highly suggest checking solana based token's advice on how to check for scams as I am not the best person for Solana based shitcoin scams. 
* Never connect to unknown dApps. Defi is a world where YOU are responsible. Some dApps out there can drain your wallet. Do not connect or sign things on your wallet that you don't know what it's for. Always do your research on the dApps. 
* If you are new and not used to trenches, be prepared to lose 99.99% of your sol or eth on shitcoins. That's how you learn what to look out for, honestly..
* Do not buy NFTs at the moment, they are dead.
* If you are not within the first 10 buyers of a hot shitcoin, you are last. You will be exit liquidity. Many marketcaps reach 10 million market cap then back down to 100k. It is what it is. Buy high sell low logic applies almost every time.

**2027 and beyond - Has bitcoin become a dinosaur? What's next for DeFi?**

  
This is a very good topic and maybe an insight that you'd like to know for the next in this crypto wild west of Defi. Yes bitcoin is old, bitcoin is slow. However, bitcoin has and always will be king. It does not print like eth or solana. 

>  
But what about making shitcoins on Bitcoin? Can Bitcoin have something like Eth or Sol?

  
There already is something like that, it's called ""Runes"". Runes is a HOT new protocol that uses Bitcoin's messaging system to let you make tokens (they're called runes on bitcoin). It's a slow protocol currently which takes about 10 minutes to 30 minutes for a transaction and costs alot. It congests bitcoin miners. 

Crypto is all about the hot new thing. The hot new thing always comes one cycle earlier and gets popular in the next cycle. I will explain the cycles in the next topic. One hot shitcoin equivalent of runes is called DOG\*GO\*TO\*THE\*MOON ($DOG). It's the biggest rune currently on the bitcoin ecosystem. Its around 1B mcap already. 

Why am I mentioning Runes? I am not sure whether Runes will be the next big thing. However I do know one thing, bitcoin has the biggest maxis and biggest share of the market. Runes protocol opened up DeFi for bitcoin. If you want to make your own runes, you can download Magic Eden Wallet or Phantom Wallet, and use Magic Eden Wallet to trade runes.

Using the same messaging system, there's also an NFT equivalent called ""Ordinals"". I would not buy Ordinals , it will suffer the same fate as NFTs. 

The beauty of Runes is that the native currency is Bitcoin. There are no other coins that you need to buy before you dive into Runes shitcoin narratives. Could it beat 2024 Solana world? Who knows? All I know is, a few dApp builders are racing to solve a few problems with the runes ecosystem including myself. 

>  
What about SUI? My crypto friend was talking about SUI at work

  
Do your own research about SUI. It could also very well be the next Solana. SUI is much faster than Bitcoin Runes so it's easy to use. Only time will tell whether a slow titan (Bitcoin) or a small chain like SUI will win the next cycles hype.

\----

  
**Narrative advice**

Every cycle, check for the next narrative. You can buy and hope that your picks become the hot new topic in the next cycle. Something that is brewing now like bitcoin runes shitcoins or dapps OR sui native coin, sui shit tokens or dapps might be the winner in 2027. It's upto the dApp developers to come up with the hot new shovel that will drive these type of narratives. 



# Crypto Cycles and Insight

I am sure you've heard about the bitcoin halving cycles and have learned that majority of the people use these cyclical nature to buy low and sell high. 6 months post halving is when bull run tends to start. A few months later Alt season where the alt coins (ETH, Solana etc.) start to run and it ends with a bang with memes. 

However, in 2024, we've started with memes. There was a huge pump before halving and some people are saying that the cycle is left shifted. Others are saying that this is a super cycle. No matter what happens and have already happened, if you look at the chart, 2022 was the lowest point that your crypto expert friend have DCA'd through. They have already expected that halving or around halving will be the bull run. So far they look like geniuses, but a dump will come again eventually. It's your job to understand how the previous cycles worked and how this cycle is so far. Find similarities and differences between the previous cycles and this cycle. 

Some example of similarities:

* Halving again called the bull run (controversial I know - you may have another opinion)
* BTC climbing before alt season truly starts
* We are in phase 4 of bitcoin cycle (again controversial)
* We are in Belief or Thrill stage in psychology of market  (controversial)

  
Some examples of differences:

* Meme season started first this time around
* Pre halving pump
* Institutional acceptance (American and Global ETFs)

  
With these differences, you must make your own judgement. Does institutional acceptance mean a super cycle? Do these new boomers who buy the ETFs pull out fast because they think a gain of 20% is a gain of 2 years ? But crypto is used to 300% - 400% minimum.. what happens now? 

No one knows honestly, and everyone's entry point is different. It's up to you when you want to enter. You can either enter now in this part of cycle or enter during a bear market in 2 years. What if the bear market does not come for 4 years? Do you just sit on fiat?

Only YOU can make your decision, I am just here to provide you with some history and narrative.   


>Okay I want to enter now, what are my options? What are the narratives? I understood Defi and bitcoin cycles but what about meme , AI or gaming narratives? 

  
Meme season is a very risky season, the pumps will come without any build up and dump before you can pull out. The pumps usually last 1 day before a 90% dump

AI and Gaming are a hit or miss, you can do your own research to see whether any of those coins pumped right before halving. If they did, perhaps they are the winning horse you want to take on. 

>Overall, do your own research into the winning horses and sit tight. If they're already in All time high (ATH), perhaps avoid it since it's in ""price discovery"". Once it's in price discovery you must be ready to DCA out (take profits), instead of timing the top. No one knows where the top is. **Currently Alt Season has yet to start. Bitcoin needs to stop before Alts pump.**

  


Macroeconomics

This is another controversial topic as others may have other opinions but aside from halving where the supply is cut, interest rate of Global liquidity (USD) still has a large part to play with bitcoin price. When they print USD out of thin air for cheap (low interest), investors tend to put it into stocks , real estate and crypto. With halving cutting the supply of fresh bitcoin, and interest rates dropping - bitcoin price against USD is climbing hard and fast.  

ETFs in the west have also put a strain on the demand. Demand has outweighed so much that every day the boomers are purchasing 40 days of fresh supply of bitcoin. Currently they're buying OTC (over the counter) in bulk from bitcoin holders who held for years. They're not buying from the exchanges.. if they did, the price would've shot up much more. However, there will come a time where OTC dries up and they either tap into cex, and dex or their ETF prices start to climb. This will make bitcoin price go up regardless. 

When Bitcoin and it's ETFs have climbed to a significant amount of market cap, they will jump into ETH ETFs. That will signal the alt season and alt coins will start to climb. 

There are 2 rumoured Solana ETF filings in 2024 as well. 

^(I am sure, you guys are very well versed in macro economics, it would be great to have more additions into this chapter here. This is a deep topic that requires your help.)

# Do's and Don'ts

1. If you are new, do not have expectations with memecoins or shitcoins. DYOR. If you are not first 10 you are last.
2. If you are new, avoid price discovery coins. Buy coins that climbed before halving (winning horses) but not yet ATH from earlier. They will reach their ATH and go past ATH into price discovery. Examples below:
   1. ETH - Not yet price discovery
   2. SOL - Just flirting with price discovery and ATH
   3. BTC - Well into price discovery
3. If you are in Defi wild west, please read the DeFi section to understand the game. Start with money you are okay with losing. Get into X spaces, X and telegram / discord groups before you buy blindly. Read the smart contracts or use token sniffer or charting tools to look at tokenomics and metrics.
4. If you are getting into building, look at new narratives rather than current narratives. You are already too late. 
5. If you are a shitcoin owner, please know that scamming will get you caught. I have seen too many getting caught and its well deserved.
6. Do not believe X influencers or Youtubers, when they're shilling something, they're usually in on it. 
7. Do not blindly believe any thing you read on Yahoo Finance, and any other crypto news outlets. Yahoo finance and other news outlets have paid articles ranging from $500 to 25k. 
8. Do not blindly believe a new shiller DMing you about this next new hot coin thats launched, they're paid shillers on X or telegram. 
9. Do not connect to any unknown dAPPs.
10. Do not keep your money in CEX, or hot wallet keep it inside ledger. I am guilty myself of this and might get screwed any time.

 I was fine with my portfolio until the article came out recently suggesting U.S. based projects may end up being tax free. Now I see several of those altcoins as well as some others that are heating up. Meanwhile, my portfolio seems to have taken a little break. 

I know I should let my winners continue running.. but I can't help but think a larger spread would guarantee a good run, while a smaller spread is gambling on a few that you think will continue to be big winners..

But if you're like lots of Redditors who aren't familiar with Unstoppable Domain you might not even know what they are or how to use them.

# What are Unstoppable Domains?

Your Unstoppable Domain in its simplest form is a series of Smart Contracts that allows you to engage with Web 3 in a more simplified and accessible way. Essentially replacing your long and cumbersome 0xethaddress with an easier to remember .moon domain.

**Two of the most common uses of your Unstoppable Domain include:**

* Using your new .moon domain to create a Web3 profile with Unstoppable
   * Using your .moon domain as an extension of your web2 presence
* Makes sending and receiving Crypto easier and less stressful and decreases the likelihood of sending crypto to an incorrect address.

# Using your Domain as a web 3 profile

Did you know you can look up a profile for any unstoppable domain using the following template: ud.me/(Your UD Domain here).

Below are some examples:

* [ud.me/gabester.moon](http://ud.me/gabester.moon)
* [ud.me/zoomer.moon](http://ud.me/zoomer.moon)
* [ud.me/sailor.moon](http://ud.me/sailor.moon)

These profiles are customizable and you can choose what to and what not to share with viewers on your profile.

https://preview.redd.it/bkl4deh3zr2e1.png?width=458&format=png&auto=webp&s=11d10c86ee6b2253267969eaecae9347d6525a35

In addition to customizable profiles Unstoppable has a built in chat system where owners of domains can communicate with other domain holders and even join badge gated group chats.

https://preview.redd.it/vc4v65c1zr2e1.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=aac61c353e688c8d9f218da563dbe7c19a59c924

Everyone with at least one Moon domain can join a group chat for .moon domains holder on UD by pressing Join Group Chat on the following link. [https://ud.me/gabester.moon?openBadgeCode=moon-tld-1&action=invite](https://ud.me/gabester.moon?openBadgeCode=moon-tld-1&action=invite)

**Although there are already existing ways to communicate with others on web3 such as sending Memos in transactions. Unstoppable Domain Chat is a simplified and more familiar way to communicate to other users (who have UD profiles and messaging enabled) on the blockchain.**

\-----

Of course users can also choose to establish an identity with their .moon domain on web 2 platforms as well. I'm sure we can all think of X users who use a domain in their name on their X account. This gives .moon domain holders the ability to instantly stand out and be recognizable to each other on Web 2.

\---------

# Using your .moon domain to send and receive Crypto.

Have you ever needed to send crypto from a wallet/account on one device to a wallet/account on another device? Getting your public address sent between devices can be both stress inducing and nerve wracking.

What if I told you there was an easier way to do it and a way to protect yourself from:

* Accidents in typing/copying an address
* Address poisoning

Using your .moon domain you can map where payments should go on hundreds of assets/networks when sent to your domain. For example I mapped an address for Solana on my gabester.moon domain and can now easily transfer Solana to my mapped destination by directing the send to my gabester.moon domain - vastly simplifying the process of sending/receiving crypto from any device and reducing the stress of dealing with such a long public domain.

For help adding Crypto addresses to your domain check out this UD help article.

Unfortunately Arbitrum One/Nova and thus Moons are not compatible with mapping in Unstoppable Domains but it's on their roadmap so it should hopefully be added in the future."

   * These incidents birthed a more amplified need for better regulatory framework. Several high GDP countries like the US, China and some EU countries began outlawing crypto. 
   * In response to this, the crypto market had its worst bear during this period with a dip below the $1 trillion market cap and a 'fear & greed index' below 6. 
   * Most crypto assets saw their lowest low in this period with BTC ($18k), ETH ($800), SOL ($11) and others.

* 2024 saw the introduction of scalable chains and networks like the L2s, use of blobs, upgrades to DAGs etc. 
   * With L2s, Arbitrum and ZK tech became scalability powerhouse in the Ethereum ecosystem leveraging the highly liquid ecosystem. 
   * Solana’s fire-dancer upgrade saw network adoption soar too. 
   * Then, the BTC spot ETF (with the options market already begun in Q4 2024) factor enters the debate seeing a multiple approval and halving set a new adoption race (attracting mainstream financial actors into crypto). 

However, one of the 4 major factors remain prevalent heading into Q4 of 2024 (regulatory landscape) but has already seen significant sway of sentiment with the: 

* outcome of the 2024 US Presidential elections, 
* upcoming resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler
* court ruling of BTC as a legal asset in China
* adoption and use of MiCA (EU crypto regulatory framework) begining from December 30, 2024
* impending approval of ETH and SOL spot ETFs

Also, the introduction of BTCfi and Ethereum restaking might open the crypto ecosystem to more institutional investors heading into 2025. With all these events and more ecosystem upgrade expected in coming months, could 2025 finally be the year for that huge improvement in crypto adoption?"

I hold about 1 BTC and that's it, nothing else. I don't want to go into altcoins, I want to limit my risk to BTC/SOL/ETH for this bullrun.

How would you distribute a three coin portfolio today? Considering that ETH is very cheap in BTC, should I move some over now? How would you decide on the distribution between BTC/SOL/ETH? Since I'm a Raoul Pal disciple, I tend to believe more in Solana, so my thoughts are to go:

1. 50% BTC
2. 35% SOL
3. 15% ETH

Are Solana's thousands of meme coins getting setup for pump and dumps and rugpulls for 2025?",2024-11-18 16:39:29.000000,"This probably won't happen for a while, and probably will pump more before it crashes (because greed).

But these Solana meme coin could be a ticking time bomb for 2025.

# -How hard is it to make a meme coin on Solana?

Far easier than I think most people realize. Anyone can make their Solana meme coin in about 10-20 minutes.

There are dapps for token creator that makes it easy, so you don't need to have that much technical skills or know much about smart contracts. And there's sites to put them up for trading.

# -How much does it cost to make a meme coin on Solana?

It might be less than you've just spent on your current bag of Dogshitpoop coins.

It can cost from $100 to $1,000 to create the token. The main cost is gonna be marketing.

You don't need much of a cult following to make that money back.

# -How many meme coins have been made?

It's hard to keep track, there's such an insane amount of them.

On PumpFun alone, which is one of the easiest place to make a Solana meme coin, they've created new ones at an average of nearly 10,000 a day, sometimes topping at over 20,000 new meme coins a day, since last March.

https://preview.redd.it/hnwxs958so1e1.jpg?width=752&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d1ba3d50da0da3599d3ea72dfd4a2d9d3ac6f78

# -What's the market cap of these meme coins?

Just the top 5 Solana meme coins have a combined market cap of $11Billion.

The top one sits at $3B right now, right below ICP and HBAR, and above Polygon and Arbitrum.

# -What is the purpose of these coins?

A few of them are legitimately for fun and for their communities, but most have only one aim: making money.

Especially the ones making claims that they're special and combining AI,  NFT art (and other buzzwords) for a meme coin revolution.

Put yourself in the shoes of a meme coin creator. The goal is to create a cult following, exploit the crypto frenzy and bullrun. Milk that as much as your greed and tolerance can handle, until you start using your cult followers as exit liquidity, and pull your major stack, hopefully before the bull cycle ends, because we're probably not gonna see most of these meme coins again.

# -What would a Solapocalypse look like?

It could be very mild, and have projects pump and dump at very different times, not affecting the market much, averting any real ""Solapocalypse"".

In an even better scenario, the majority of the big projects could have diamond hands, and we'll never have a Solapocalypse, and meme coins will simply crash when the crypto market enters its bear cycle.

Or it could turn into a panic sale, with creators rugging right after another, as they are all worried everyone is pulling out at the same time and the Solana meme coin market might be collapsing.

It might not necessarily make the crypto market crash nor end the bullmarket, but it might cause at least a brief panic and dip in the market. We've seen this many times when we have a nasty event in the middle of a bullrun, with a 30%-40% correction, then the market bounces right back and has new highs.

I could see that latter scenario happening in 2025, as it would seem just so typical of crypto.

# -Will Solana survive if there is a major ""Solapocalypse""?

Yes, it will be fine.

I really can't see a scenario where Solana would be killed off, just because of a collapse of the stupid meme coins people created on the chain.

It might have a temporary dip, and struggle briefly, but likely will bounce back."

Repeat over and over simple stories and people gather around.

The appealing story that is repeated over and over on Coindesk, CNBC, Forbes, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube is ""Solana is faster and cheaper than Ethereum and will replace this old tech"".

The Ethereum Foundation would not waste money hiring a team of communicative people to explain to journalists, economists, politicians, on YouTube, etc what Ethereum is and does. **For example** thanks to a series of past upgrades, fees in the Ethereum ecosystem have been lower than Solana's for months while the speed (number of transactions per second) has been equivalent (Solana cheats by counting protocol messages).
On the monetary side, the number of existing ETH has been decreasing since The Merge (comparable to stock buybacks) whereas SOL inflates at +5% per year.

---

PS. Why the hype around Solana is a simple story too beautiful to be true: The number of validators on Solana is very low* and so low that the operators colluded several times to halt the network, and recently to push an emergency upgrade.

The whole point of the concept of blockchain is decentralisation (meaning _impossibility to collude_), otherwise the blockchain is just a database managed by a few people, which doesn't bring any advantage. Solana is a database.

\* it is low because they are losing money, which is a unique situation (I would say a flaw) in the world of blockchains, caused by the extremely high hardware and bandwidth requirements. They lose money despite creating +5% coins per year.
Meanwhile, the number of existing ETH has been decreasing since The Merge and Ethereum validators are profitable."

BTC prior to its major move in 2021 retested and bettered its previous ATH in Nov/Dec 2020 while Eth was also on track to retest it ATH.. We could be seeing a similar trajectory for Solana considering its recent price action.

Sol may have the potential to replicate Eth success but I feel it need a solid fundamental to get that push just like Firedancer impact late last year. With spot ETF not likely to happen in this bull circle what could be that factor to look forward to and how high can it go in this bull run"

Don't always try to find logic in what should pump more and what shouldn't.  ",2024-11-12 16:31:30.000000,"Everything is gonna pump, but not always what you think should pump the most. It's not always gonna follow tech.

It's not always gonna be about what project could solve the trilemma better, what is more decentralized, what has better smart contracts, etc...

# -The most significant factor as we get deeper into a bullrun will be hype and trend, the more the market gets emotional.

We're gonna see some great projects not get much love, and some flawed ones or even meme or shitcoins get more hype.

Bullruns are emotional and work more like Instagram trends than on technical merit. The deeper we get into them, the less they have rhyme or reason. 

# -Don't fight the trend.

Trends are your friend. Once they carry momentum, it's hard for them to stop.

When the market has its mind set on a narrative or a trend, it's hard to undo that.

# -There are times where tech and hype can overlap, if the narrative is right.

In the short run, when you're speculating on just a bullrun, better tech only works if there's some hot hype to go with it. Some bell and whistles, or something that can be marketed easily about that tech that will still catch the interest of the average person who is clueless about tech.

We've seen in past runs how tech like ALGO that was hyped as carbon neutral, Solana for its incredible speed, ADA as based on science, MATIC as something that can make Ethereum faster and cheaper, and many chains like AVAX hyped as ""Ethereum killers"", had simple digestible concepts to hype them.

Which is not to say that the hype didn't come from actual merit, but from something easily sellable to an average person.

Please be aware of some of the most popular Scams:

# Youtube ads, most commonly about ""doubling your money"".

I have gotten tons of these on my mobile device in the past two weeks. Usually regarding XRP or Solana ""Giving back to the community"" - Send us your funds and we'll send you back double. It's literally a doubling money scam with a new face.

# MEV Bot Scams

This one gets advertised a lot on Youtube as well. Idea is to download a trading bot that will allow you to make money passively by sandwiching users with high Slippage. However you download the bot and then get drained, **seriously if you ever see something about this it's a scam, DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT**. Nobody with a good sandwich bot will give it to you, or they would lose potential income from that bot by allowing other users to trade it.

# Stupidly high APR (commonly advertised on Instagram)

This one is targeted at greedy amateurs and offer stupidly high APR like 2-3% per day for staking ETH. However it's a scam and when you set it up they just drain your wallet.

# Reddit Chat Scams

Seriously if you get chat requests on Reddit about Crypto they're a scammer:

# Fake Exchange Email and Phone Call Scams

This one is just pure social engineering. Sending an Email or Phone Call pretending to be an exchange saying something is urgently wrong and trying to get you to provide 2fa information for the scammer to access your exchange account and drain you.

# Classic Pig Butchering

A long term scam where someone messages you in an unsolicited way then works to build report with the idea that you eventually invest in a Scam Crypto Exchange. This one never stopped and you should be aware of it, but the other scams above are on the uptick."

# [Here at $HEGE](https://www.reddit.com/r/HegeCoin/) we're well aware of the stigma around memecoins, so we'd like to answer your questions. 

# In a sea of scams on the Solana blockchain, we aim to provide a secure and trusted environment for our holders.

Hege Coin was launched by a developer (myself) that got rug pulled A LOT. Fed up with this, I decided to create my own project. Working as a graphic and brand designer, I had the creative skills needed to start a project, and some knowledge of the Solana ecosystem.

I initially had many questions on how to successfully launch a coin and turned to Reddit, specifically , looking for advice. The post received a huge response and sparked a lot of interest. After a few weeks of presale and countless tweaks to the characters, website and tokenomics, we launched. $2M market cap on night one, a sharp drop the following day and an organic rise to an all time high of $31M a few months later, it’s been quite the journey!

**Hege is a Solana memecoin, with a unique twist...**  
Hege is a hedgehog with a quest to impress his crush Hegena. We've gamified the token by creating 10 chapters to his story, every chapter is released at various market cap levels, with chapter 10 being released at a $1 billion market cap. The production value has increased with each milestone, with the upcoming chapter 5 (unlocked at $50M) taking over a month to animate.

**Why has Hege been successful?**  
An engaging narrative and widespread appeal has been the key. We have built a brand that includes a cast of relatable characters and a story that is easy to connect with. The Hege story features 4 characters, Hege, Hegena, Hendrix and Helena. These characters are all built around stereotypes we see everyday in modern society, creating a story that is relatable and easily memeable.

The project has attracted a talented team and creative community that has been creating Hege content and helping spread the word since day 1. We currently have 12,800 holders, 6,200 members on Telegram, 22.2K followers on X, 8K subscribers on Youtube, over 1K followers over Instagram/Facebook and almost 500 images/videos in our meme folder.

**Born on Reddit, thriving on Reddit**  
It all started here on Reddit with a single post on the Solana subreddit , and since then Reddit has remained our most successful promotional platform. We've been labelled the 'King of Reddit' in the memecoin space multiple times, as a large percentage of our community have discovered us here. We're aware Reddit is the first place many new memecoin investors go, therefore investing in Hege means you're betting on the fact that retail will come flooding into Reddit as the bull run really starts to accelerate.

**An NFT Collection (with utility)**  
Last month, we launched[ Hegends](https://app.hegecoin.com/), a collection of 2,222 NFTs that pay a dividend to its holders. The public mint sold out in 90 minutes, and they are now trading on Tensor & Magic Eden. From the mint proceeds, we raised over $200,000 that will ALL be invested back into the project in one way or another. Whether that's buybacks, marketing funds, CEX listing fees or investments in further utility, it will ALL stay in the Hege ecosystem.

The NFTs feature a utility where every month, 5% of Hege tokens in the mint wallet will be distributed amongst NFT holders. Each NFT held will entitle a holder to distribution from the bank, and the collection features 5 rarity levels that multiply the amount of $HEGE tokens you receive, ranging from 1X for common NFT holders, all the way up to 10X for legendary NFT holders.

For more information on Hege, check out our website: [hegecoin.com](http://hegecoin.com)

**Giveaway**  
Enough of the talk about ourselves. We'd like to celebrate Hege making an appearance on r/CryptoCurrency, we’re giving away **a total of $1000 to the best 5 questions asked below!** You must also follow the r/HegeCoin subreddit to be in with a chance of winning. Winners will be asked for a Solana wallet address via DM on **November 2nd 2024**.

**AMA**  
Hege is a memecoin with no flashy tech, promises of changing the world or the way we transact, but we're honest about what we're doing and what we aim to achieve.

We think that memecoins are one of the best ways to bring awareness to Cryptocurrency, so we're wondering if you have objections to memecoins, what are they?"

1. RawrXD
2. Glorp
3. (a coin with an offensive name)
4. Sigma
5. Gigachad

I think these coins are all based on the Solana blockchain

They have Telegram accounts but they require some sketchy identity verification to get into. Not otherwise able to message the accounts directly because I don't have a checkmark on X.

Where do you guys find niche meme coins? I'm fully prepared to lose all the money I put in them but I don't mind gambling a little to see what happens. Thanks"

(Protip: You know a coin is at least shady when it has been promoted by an influencer)

Here’s a list of **some** popular coins that didn’t pay influencers to push their coins but instead focused on building something people saw value on their own:

* **Bitcoin (BTC)** – The OG that never needed influencers. Bitcoin’s reputation as digital gold stands strong on the shoulders of its decentralized, community-driven movement.
* **Ethereum (ETH)** – The backbone of decentralized apps (dApps) and smart contracts. Ethereum continues to evolve without chasing influencer-driven hype.
* **Cardano (ADA)** – Focused on peer-reviewed research and scientific rigor, Cardano’s dedication to long-term goals has kept it away from paying for attention.
* **Monero (XMR)** – Privacy is power, and Monero has always stood by its commitment to privacy without paying for promotion. Its tech speaks louder than words.
* **Litecoin (LTC)** – ""The silver to Bitcoin’s gold"" has earned its place through utility and reliability, not paid promotions.
* **Tezos (XTZ)** – Focused on governance and self-amendment, Tezos is all about building a blockchain that evolves with its community—no influencer noise needed.
* **Zcash (ZEC)** – Another privacy-focused project, Zcash lets its zero-knowledge proofs and privacy protocols do the talking.
* **Algorand (ALGO)** – With a focus on solving blockchain trilemma (decentralization, scalability, and security), Algorand focuses on building a robust ecosystem without flashy marketing.
* **Cosmos (ATOM)** – The internet of blockchains is here, and Cosmos is letting its vision of interconnectivity take center stage—no influencer payments required.
* **Chainlink (LINK)** – Powering smart contracts with real-world data, Chainlink lets its use cases and partnerships show its strength, no influencer hype needed.
* **Polkadot (DOT)** – Focused on interoperability and multi-chain solutions, Polkadot continues to build out a solid tech foundation without paying for followers or hype.
* **NEO (NEO)** – ""The Ethereum of China"" has been quietly developing its ecosystem and bridging digital economies without shelling out to influencers.
* **Avalanche (AVAX)** – Promising high throughput and low fees, Avalanche is proving its worth with solid tech, not influencer endorsements.
* **Solana (SOL)** – While the project is known for its fast and low-cost transactions, it’s also worth noting that Solana has made waves through innovation rather than relying on paid promotions.

(I think the list is accurate based on my research, don't trust me, do your own research.  
In case I'm wrong, please correct me and I will update the list)

Also I don't like every coin I listed here, due to various reasons but gotta pay respect where it's due.

Edits:

-For people asking why a certain coin in not in the list, I added some coins, If you want to name others feel free to do so in the comments. There are thousands of coins, unfortunatly I can't put them all in a list and also verify every single one, which hasn't paid promoters.

Even though Solana's price has experienced solid growth during this time, the decline in its core developer community is certainly something worth investigating further. A strong and engaged developer community is essential for keeping the ecosystem healthy, innovative, and thriving in the competitive landscape of crypto.

6. **Firedancer** is live on mainnet, but in 'non-voting mode' which means it cannot produce blocks and is **only doing about \~30% of what a validator does.** 

7. **RPC endpoint architecture allows operators to reorder transactions and front-run.** 

8. ***$7.5 billion SOL, is continued to be sold-off by FTX, a major unlock occurs in March 2025, and continued unlocks every month up till 2028.*** (Repeated due to importance). 

9. **5 million daily active users is a myth, 4.5 million of these hold 0 SOL, and much more hold < 1, they are created with an intention to inflate metrics,** notice the large uptick in August, also 1 user(bot) could technically have 4 million wallets. 

10. **The Top 18 validators control +33% of the entire staked Solana supply, meaning they can collaboratively block consensus and censor transactions.**

TL;DR: I added a comedy flair for ""comedy"" purposes because if someone told you that this is one of the major crypto networks you'd indeed think that crypto is a scam...

Only considering ""relay"" like nodes, not validators.

To me, having Mcap/node > Bitcoin's means your network could be overvalued given current centralization/lack of decentralization. It could also mean that the market is pricing in future benefit/utility provided by a network despite its current lack of decentralization. Any of these networks could become more decentralized going forward, I'm not trying to knock them, although BNB is a bit concerning to me lol.

\*Note: Solana numbers are from 2023, I could not find anything more current. I had to subtract consensus nodes from total nodes to derive the number of rpc nodes.

I could not find node counts for TON, ADA, AVAX, or LINK taht did not include validator counts, if anyone can point me to that information I would appreciate the help!

(Also launched via [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/frens-my))

It hosts a world map that displays the geolocation of participating and consenting users. Built for Solana, with plans to expand to other major blockchains in due time.

You can check out where your fellow NFT holders are on the map. And if you’re part of this community, you can join in and plonk yourself onto the map, while repping your favourite NFT that you hold as your avatar.

I actually made this for and during the Solana Breakpoint convention in Singapore earlier this month, but never shipped in time. So I spent a little more time scaling up the map up to cover the entire world instead.

But Frens.my really shines when it's used for IRL events. For example: A web3 convention with thousands of attendees; the map on the app is auto-zoomed in on the venue; get enough people to hop on the app with you on their mobile device, and suddenly the map is swarming with avatars; find fellow holders of NFT communities you're a part of at the venue, call them over with the live chat, and have a ball!

Thanks for your time.

It seems as though the burn-mechanism isn't working so great on SOL, it has over 13.5% YTD inflation.

When you take into consideration that most of the transactions on SOL are failed or consensus transactions it doesn't paint a great picture.

If you factor in team and VC unlocks the inflation is more like \~20%.

Pretty crazy when you consider that SOL technically has an infinite supply and they've been known to lie about this stuff from the beginning.

What is the point of any of this if they can just print more SOL infinitely?"

With initial plans for a memecoin launchpad built on DOGE. Bringing with it the possibilities associated with DOGE now being connected to Bitcoin through RGB++

RGB++ has been receiving a lot of interest recently from both the Bitcoin and Asian crypto communities after having first being built for Bitcoin and its very novel approach of 'Isomorphic binding' which requires no actual bridge to the other chain but rather, mapping 2 chains along side each other.

**Quote from recent Techflow article:**

>It is reported that RGB++ will support the $Doge chain in the next step, and will launch the Meme launchpad on the Doge chain after the launch of BTC Meme launchpad. At the same time, he also said that the lightning network is the strategic direction of CKB's long-term layout, which will greatly increase the competitive advantage of the RGB++ protocol. It is worth noting that at present, many teams are not only focusing on the development of the protocol itself, but also promoting the compatibility of their protocols with lightning networks, such as Taproot Assets and RGB. Up to now, RGB++ ecological Meme leading coin SEAL has risen by 50% in 24 hours, and CKB has risen by 12%.

**INTRODUCTION TO RGB++**

RGB++ is an extension protocol based on RGB, utilizing single-use seals and client-side validation technology to manage state changes and transaction verification. It maps UTXOs to Nervos CKB Cells via isomorphic bindings and uses script constraints on the CKB and the other chain to verify the correctness of state computation and the validity of ownership changes.

RGB++ addresses the technical challenges faced by the original RGB protocol in practical implementation and provides more possibilities, such as blockchain-enhanced client validation, transaction folding, shared states with ownerless contracts, and non-interactive transfers. It brings Turing-complete contract extensions and performance enhancements to other UTXO chains without the need for cross-chain transfers or compromising security.

I’ve been following the crypto space for a while now and have made small investments in some of the well-known coins.

That said, I’m curious—what do we really expect for the future of crypto? Is this still uncharted territory?

It feels like crypto isn’t comparable to something like the S&P 500, where you can invest and reasonably expect solid returns over a decade. Is it more of a gamble to invest in something purely digital?

Honestly, I’m just trying to understand what these coins truly represent. Take Dogecoin, for example—Elon Musk hyped it up, skyrocketed its value, and then it crashed, leaving many people with significant losses. Sure, some got rich early on, but at what cost to others?

What’s your honest take—can crypto be a legitimate long-term investment, or is it just speculation?"

Elon musk was pushing the purchase and sale of DOGE coin back in 2021 era. It only ever went to .37 or so. Fast forward 3yrs. Elon gets appointed to a new role. This role is brand new, new to the government too. It's a new dept. the department of government efficiency. The Department O Government Efficiency (DOGE)
I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but this is too much of a coincidence to not mean something.

Not sure how a NFT would tie to the government efficiency or why the acronyms are a perfect match. 
 

“Elon Musk, a long-time supporter of Dogecoin, has also indirectly contributed to the coin's recent stability. Known for his past statements boosting Dogecoin's value, Musk's influence continues to resonate with the cryptocurrency community.”

I know, analogies most of the time are stupid. Still, if we imagine cryptos as living organisms in a digital ecosystem, only the strongest and most adaptable are likely to survive in the long run.

So, how does this analogy work?

In nature, species that adapt to their environment survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits. Similarly, cryptocurrencies that adapt to market demands, technological advancements, and regulatory changes are more likely to thrive.

Let’s look at some examples:

Bitcoin (BTC): The Digital Pioneer
- Analogy: Bitcoin is like the first species to colonize a new environment—it’s established and has a significant advantage due to being the first mover.
- Survival Traits: Widespread recognition and adoption as a store of value. Despite scalability issues, solutions like the Lightning Network are helping it adapt.

Ethereum (ETH): The Versatile Adapter
- Analogy: Ethereum is akin to organisms that evolve new functions to exploit different niches.
- Survival Traits: Introduced smart contracts, enabling a whole ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). The transition to Ethereum 2.0 aims to improve scalability and energy efficiency.

Tezos (XTZ): The Self-Evolver
- Analogy: Tezos is like a species with the ability to self-mutate to adapt quickly to environmental changes.
- Survival Traits: Features a self-amending blockchain that can upgrade without hard forks, allowing it to evolve smoothly. On-chain governance lets stakeholders vote on protocol changes, ensuring collective adaptation.

Cardano (ADA): The Research-Driven Species
- Analogy: Cardano resembles species that evolve carefully through gradual changes backed by research (think of humans developing advanced tools).
- Survival Traits: Built on peer-reviewed research and formal verification, aiming for long-term scalability and security.

Dogecoin (DOGE): The Unexpected Survivor
- Analogy: Like the cockroach, which survives in various conditions despite the odds.
- Survival Traits: Started as a meme but gained a strong community and widespread popularity, showing that community support can be a key survival factor.

Just as in nature, the crypto environment is competitive, and resources (like investment and developer attention) are limited. Cryptocurrencies that can’t keep up may become obsolete, much like extinct species.

So, what do you think? Am I too off? Which cryptocurrencies do you believe are best equipped to survive?"

Since January 1st the amount of Memecoins in the top 100 have shot up from 3 to 15.,2024-11-15 00:44:03.000000,"I want to be completely clear this post isn't suggesting anyone buy or gamble on memecoins. For every ""successful"" memecoin there are tens of thousands (if not more) ""memecoins"" that launch and slowly go to 0, or end in a straight rug.

However this post does aim to point at a continuing trend in the Crypto Market.

As of January 1st 2024 there were a total of 3 memecoins in the top 100

* [https://web.archive.org/web/20240101101938/https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/](https://web.archive.org/web/20240101101938/https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/)

In May 2024 that number was up to 7 meme coins that were in the top 100

* [https://web.archive.org/web/20240510054652/https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/](https://web.archive.org/web/20240510054652/https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/)

As of tonight there are a total of 15 meme coins that are in the top 100

* [https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/)

**So the question becomes what the hell is going on with Memecoins this cycle?**

One immediate and noticeable trend is Binance yes that exchange formerly lead by CZ Binance (who plead guilty to violating money laundering laws and spent 4 months in prison) is listing a bunch of Memecoins.

Seriously two of these Memecoins in the top 100 were launched DAYS AGO and are already being listed on Binance and as a result are in the top 100 by marketcap.

So obviously there is some CEX lead hype and possible manipulation but is there more going on with this trend? Maybe Moons should just embrace their memeish name and we'll all be rich."

Thinking about the impact of companies like Robinhood and Coinbase, it seems like knowing when a new coin will be available to millions of users could set someone up for insane profits.

With their massive user bases (24M+ on Robinhood, 70M+ on Coinbase), the impact of a new coin listing is huge, especially if it’s something people couldn’t easily access before. Just curious if any regulations are in place to stop this kind of thing – it feels like a serious potential for insider trading without any oversight or repercussions (which seems like a growing trend). 

Similarly with Trump announcing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and knowing that it would cause a spike in Dogecoin (thanks to Elon’s affiliation and the fact that Dogecoin is now somewhat acknowledged on a government level), it’s hard not to wonder what people in the loop are doing with that knowledge. Are there any laws that would actually prevent them from cashing in on that? 

I’m not looking to make this political or share personal opinions on this topic, as I don’t have enough information to form a meaningful perspective yet."

But I am now wondering with the influence that might be had on doge for some time to come if it could be worth buying for the sake of cashing in on. 

I'd expect a rugpull with it like it always happens but I imagine this could be in the early stages of whatever happens next to it. Maybe it pumps to nearly a dollar before the bottom falls out again?

What do you think- worth it or you wouldn't touch it?

elon is going to be the emperor next to the other emperor (putin) next to dog (trump).. so i know elon likes dogecoins, but he could short his own coin to pump up some other coin.    trump has a coin, milania… 

i mean, is it even going to pass thru the exchanges where we could get a stab at this,  or is someone playing with a trillion dollars and can just bend its price to their will. 


they’re both pretty high now… just wait a bit, sell a little, pickup a little in the dips and hope ?   

my btc will be theee for a long time… but doge…. is elon going to make doge some official coin, and it becomes #2 or even replaces bitcoin?  

i know its decentralized,   but they’ve got money powers .. like exponential amounts money than us.    


If DOGE becomes a coin every dick and jane know about, it’s gonna be in a 2-3$ range soon… and it’ll be tied to the lying presentations elon will put on like he does or did for previous things he’s done.  

i dunno. i’m trailing off


i think btc and doge will be the only two to break into the middle class family this bull run,  and the next one people will spend more on what the coin does and the culture etc."

 Student loans paused. Once in a lifetime type stuff

Retail pumped up dogecoin and every other alt you can think of.   Life was good.

We are proud to announce the launch of [The DogeList](https://thedogelist.com/). This site is designed to allow buyers and sellers to post a meeting location anywhere on the map where a person would like to transact using Dogecoin as the currency. This could be a public meetup location like a local bank, or coffee shop, or anywhere you would meet to sell a good or service.

Why Dogecoin? With a high speed, low transaction cost, transferring payment doesn't have to break the bank. Plus, Doge is very fun - much wow!

Key features:

* This site does NOT interact with your wallet or escrow transactions in any way. It is simply a way for people to find locally ""for sale"" and ""wanted"" listings, services, and brick-and-mortar locations that accept Dogecoin for payment.
* You enter the item you want to buy or sell or the service you offer and include one (or more) picture(s). You put the amount of currency you would like to receive for the item i.e. $50 USD. The site then posts the item for $50 USD and the equal amount of Dogecoin which adjusts based on the market.
* Map based searches. Instead of looking through just a list of items, you get a map-based view as well to see exactly where everything is for sale. Pin drops on the map can be anywhere in your town - choose a local coffee shop or bank as your pin drop to meet up for safety and privacy!
* You can choose to be a personal seller where you can sell goods (like used video games, cars, clothes etc) or services (like cell phone repair, dog walking, etc) and meet up at locations of your choice or you can choose to be a business account for brick-and-mortar storefronts. Business accounts have DMs turned off but includes store hours and you can direct people to your store that accepts Dogecoin as payment.

Again, we don't handle any payments or transactions. Buyers and sellers use wallets of their choice in person and don't enter any information like that into the site.

We appreciate any and all feedback! Please feel free to put any feedback here or through our profile links.

Thanks! The DogeList Team"

What I love most is that the price of DOGE doesn't matter to me anymore—I can use it IF NEEDED. For instance, I spent 4,573 DOGE on $700 worth of goods on Amazon, which would only cost around $540 today. I have continuously been accumulating long before and even after those purchases.

He decided that crypto was his ticket to fame, fortune, and possibly a private island shaped like a doge. Armed with nothing but a smartphone, a vague understanding of blockchain, and an unhealthy amount of optimism, he took all his money—the entire $142.78 of his life savings—and threw it into cryptocurrency.

The first few months were magical. His investments were skyrocketing! Bitcoin was going to the moon! Ethereum was going to Mars! Some weird coin named after a sushi roll was going to Jupiter! Alex was convinced he was a financial genius. He even started wearing sunglasses indoors, the universal sign of someone who understands markets.

Every time the price dipped, Alex bought more. It didn’t matter if it was 3 a.m. and he had to wake up for school in four hours—he was there, buying the dip. He started working odd jobs to feed his addiction. He mowed lawns, washed cars, and even babysat his neighbor’s cat, Mr. Whiskers, who somehow paid better than all his other gigs combined. But it was worth it, because Alex knew he was going to be rich. Filthy rich. Jeff Bezos was going to be calling him for loans.

One day, Alex’s portfolio hit $50,000. Yes, fifty thousand dollars. He couldn't believe it. He looked at his screen like it was the face of a newborn child. He even tried to hug it, only to knock over his glass of orange juice and short-circuit his keyboard. But that didn’t matter. He could buy a thousand keyboards now! Life was good.

Then came The Day. You know, *that* day. The day when every crypto holder collectively whispered, “Oh no.”

At first, Alex thought it was just another dip. No problem, right? He'd just buy more. But this dip didn’t stop. It didn’t even slow down. It was like someone pressed the fast-forward button on the fall from grace. Bitcoin plummeted, Ethereum followed suit, and SushiSwap—well, it flopped like a day-old sushi roll.

Alex stared at his portfolio as his $50,000 evaporated faster than the promises of a Nigerian prince in an email. His life savings were now worth less than the cost of a Starbucks latte. In a last-ditch effort to salvage his pride, Alex sold all his remaining coins and walked away with a grand total of $3.27 and some digital breadcrumbs from Dogecoin.

But instead of freaking out, Alex did something truly remarkable. He stood up, stretched, and with the confidence of someone who had just mastered the art of denial, said, “I’m in it for the tech.”

The lawsuit claimed that Musk used his influence to manipulate Dogecoin’s price with tweets and public appearances, including on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.”

The lawsuit, led by Keith Johnson and a group of fellow investors, alleged that Musk and Tesla promoted Dogecoin as a legitimate investment while orchestrating market manipulation tactics. The plaintiffs argued that his manipulation caused a price surge followed by a sharp decline that harmed investors.

But it’s not just about the big players—projects like Dogecoin are also seeing renewed interest, especially with potential new use cases on the horizon (imagine buying a Tesla with DOGE!).

There are plenty of organizations and countries in the world with multi-trillion-dollars in their war chest. Eventually, one of them might be daring enough to attempt to destroy a blockchain.

**Scenario: How might a massive organization with $500B USD and 5-10 years of preparation go about attacking each category of blockchain?**

* Proof of Work - Small cap - BSV (trivial, considering that it's been attacked multiple times already)
* Proof of Work - Large cap - Bitcoin
* Proof of Stake - Has slashing - Ethereum
* Proof of Stake - No slashing - Cardano
* Proof of Stake - Semi-decentralized - Solana
* Proof of Stake - High-safety/low-liveness - Algorand (note that reorgs are not allowed by protocol)
* Proof of Authority - Has fewer than 5 voting members - Pick your own example
* Proof of Authority - Has more than 20 voting members - Hedera
* Ethereum Layer 2 - Optimistic, at Stage 1 - Arbitrum or Optimism

**Directions**:

* Pick whichever blockchains you want to attack
* Describe how you would do it
* Estimate the cost
* The attack has to be realistic and have a **90% chance of success**
* The attack is not meant to be profitable or economically-motivated. Its purpose to cause catastrophic grief and reputational damage.
* Lastly, describe how the network might respond to fight back and repair the damage, if it's even possible

**Acceptable win conditions**:

* Reorg a block or transaction 2+ hours deep
* Block/censor transactions for 5+ days
* Double-spend on a dApp
* Permanently damage the reputation of the blockchain or cryptocurrency
* Permanently take over governance of a blockchain
* Permanently destroy 25% of TVL on a blockchain

**Unacceptable win conditions**:

* Wait for a blockchain to fail by itself. The attacker has to intentionally cause it. Thus letting Solana crash or a client bug surface on its own is not a valid win scenario.
* Create an invalid transaction, or steal crypto the attacker doesn't own. Attacks through invalid transactions are technically impossible on all major blockchains (without accidental node bugs).
* Double-spend on an exchange. Assume that all exchanges run full nodes that check for double-spends, which they do.
* Anything that uses mass assassinations or war crimes, unless completely undetectable until after the attack is completed.
* Spam attacks that increase transaction fees temporarily without also completely blocking transactions for 1+ days
* Breaking the laws of physics or reality

**Good luck, especially with the PoA ones!**

-------

**Example** of a high-success attack on any generic PoW blockchain (e.g. Litecoin, Dogecoin, Bitcoin, etc.)

1. Build multiple semiconductor plants to produce mining equipment. Also buy up other crypto mining companies whenever one quits the market when it's no longer profitable for them.
1. Attacker needs to build up sufficient equipment to exceed the network hash rate, so this will take many years. (Large semiconductor fab plants cost $10-20B, so $500B can build an army of them.)
1. Option 1: Execute 51% attack on the network, and produce empty blocks for 5 days
1. Option 2: Execute 51% attack on the network, and reorg a block 2-10 hours deep.

**Cost**: Same cost as producing sufficient mining equipment to exceed the network hash rate. $5B is more than enough for most PoW networks. Bitcoin might require $20-30B.

**How to fight back against this attack**: Not possible by design of PoW. The attacker is following valid PoW protocol and has over 51% of the network hash rate.

If the defenders hard fork to prevent empty blocks, the attacker can just add spam transactions. If the defenders hard fork to change the hashing protocol, then it would also irreversibly damage all honest miners, who would leave to another network. If the defenders block IP addresses, the attacker can constantly use different IPs and change its attack pattern. All the defenders can do is wait out the attack."

Using a 2-of-2 Multi-Party Computation (MPC) framework, each of the two Zengo parties (Zengo app on the user device and Zengo server) independently generate their own “Secret Share” during the wallet creation process. The secret shares are cryptographically locked to prevent MITM attacks.

* The share randomly generated on the user’s device is called the Personal Share and leverages the device’s hardware-based random number generator (TRNG). Only the Personal share can initialize and sign transactions, all of which are verified by the device’s hardware (Secure Enclave or TEE/Trusted Execution Environment).
* The share randomly generated on Zengo’s remote server is called the Remote Share and is used to co-sign transactions emerging from the Personal Share.

Using MPC, these two Secret Shares are able to compute their corresponding public key securely.

Even if a hacker gains access to one of the two secret shares, it is still useless to them as they cannot spend user funds. Check out our recent [ZengoWalletChallenge](https://zengo.com/zengo-wallet-bitcoin-challenge/) and [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/190s3uc/hack_a_zengo_wallet_win_10_bitcoin_ama/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to hack a Zengo Wallet holding 10 Bitcoin.

This is for those who keep on posting ""doge to $1"" or $2, $8, $17... or any other delusional fiat value.

These are the facts.

Ðogecoin mints 10K brand new coins every minute. That just over Ð100Million new coins a week or Ð5.25Billion NEW COINS per year.

If you are valuing dogecoin in fiat, every minute it requires more and more $fiat to push the price up. Moreover as the price increases it also becomes much more expensive to not only push the price up but to even maintain it. As it goes up naturally more people are selling, so there is much more down pressure.

If you look at the live charts you can see this happening.

You really don't understand how all this works if you think it is getting anywhere near $1 let alone higher.

""but it got to .7 last time!11!!1!"" - yeah that was in 2021, Ð15.75Billion new coins have been added since May 2021. That is just over 10% of the total supply back then.

Pushing the price up using hype is going to be almost impossible to get it back to .7 , but even getting it there does not mean the price will magically stay there. Millions of $ would still need continue to pour into Ðogecoin just to keep the price there.

tl;dr - Over $1 is not happening, stop your delusion.

Dogecoin is a currency, just use it and don't expect to make profits from it."

I don't understand why people are trying to predict the next memecoin when there's also a way to make big money shorting exausted memecoins.

In the chart in TA I highlighted the Bearish RSI divergence happening on the PEPE shitcoin.   
The price is going higher with less strength on the RSI meaning there's less buying power to keep the move upwards.

People are fooling themselves that this can surpass Dogecoin, It can't... 

When dogecoin started there was no memecoin concept, too new too wild, and lots of people joined in and got wrecked. Now the market is riddled with the next memecoin.

Market is too diluted with memecoins and not a single one will surpass dogecoin ATH or prob it's current Marketcap too... Why? Because people are always chasing the next one for the 1000x return. 

Pepe already reached 7B. Many people don't want 2x returns and then a dump like what happened with dogecoin so they move on to the next memecoin.

  
This is where good money can be made, you know what is the next memecoin to fail, while people are chasing out of 1M tokens what will pump 1000x you only need to pick 1 out of 10 exhausted memecoins.

Pepe chart is not bullish and the market is too hungry for low marketcaps 7B is not low..."

(33f) In 2021, I made $250,000 from Dogecoin, as well as some profits from Shib, GME, and AMC. My initial investment was just $6,000. Right when the markets hit their highs, I experienced a high of my own – my first-ever serious manic episode, which lasted for just over six months.

I had never experienced a manic episode before. It was essentially like being blacked out while simultaneously thinking I was invincible… among other things. Nobody around me knew what was happening, and neither did I. I was absolutely insane. I started posting wild stuff on social media and gained over 20k Instagram followers because of the crazy shit I was doing.

Normally, I would have put that money away or invested it responsibly. But where did that money go, you ask? This is painful…

You'd think that manic me would have gotten some nice things. Jewelry, bags, clothes, shoes. Nope…

$5,000 on art supplies and toys to donate to kid's schools (they never got donated). I left toys on the stoops of apartments in Brooklyn because I thought I was Santa Claus. I handed out Barbies to little girls on the street.

$12,000 upfront for six months of rent.

$3,000 – I bought every single food item, bottled drink, Starbucks cup, bag, etc. - every item you could buy from my neighborhood Starbucks. I also left this stuff on the stoops of multiple apartments.

$3,000 for 11 tattoos on my left arm that I would have otherwise NEVER gotten. Probably one of my biggest regrets out of everything. Just chop off my arm, please. I was never a tattoo person. Guess I am now.

$7,000 on mushrooms, weed, and ketamine.

$2,000 on new phones. I gave one away.

$2,000 divided up and passed out to people on the streets.

$800 adoption fee for a dog I later had to give up.

$3,000 on EZ-Pass. Why? I have no fcking idea.

$1,500 on crystals.

$2,000 on tie-dye clothes that I'll never wear again.

$4,000 on new furniture that I ended up putting on the side of the street.

$5,000 - I posed naked (ish) for a live painting at 3am in the East Village with two other girls. Then I bought it.

I did pay off the rest of my student loans (20k).

Honestly, there were SO many things. There's also a lot I can't remember, and I've been too horrified to look at bank statements, pictures, and videos. But the biggest?

I spent THOUUUUSANDS touring with Dead and Co for two months. I went to 12 shows and was front row for each one. I also thought John Mayer would fall in love with me if I did so. Pit tickets, flights, and hotels all over the country…

I also found my way onto a couple of well-known reality shows (not main cast) due to how insane I was acting. Some of my friends at that time were main cast; I can't say which because that's way too specific and I'm already giving up too much detail in this post.🙈 Let's just say I don't think we're friends anymore…

I eventually lost my job, my apartment, my car, my reputation, family, and friends. But what did I gain? $38,000 left over in tax debt after being audited (that's after paying what I thought I owed). I did my own taxes while manic too. WTF?

The IRS owns my ass, and now I'm on a payment plan. My family put me in the hospital for a month, I was diagnosed with bipolar, and placed (hopefully temporarily) on disability. Now I'm back living with mom and dad at 33. I had an amazing job and life in NYC for 10 years — it all crumbled.

So, I've been hiding since. Haven't touched social, and I've deleted most of my Insta feed. Deleted Facebook. I worked in PR, and a lot of my job was social, and now I've disappeared.🤷🏻‍♀️

I'm pretty sure people think I stalk John Mayer after posting him 14836x at so many shows front row. High school friends, college friends, work friends, family… they all distanced themselves, and I lost almost everyone aside from a few who I am SO grateful for. The tea was HOT that year, and being the talk of your hometown is never good.

In 2022, when I got out of the hospital, I took the $4000 I had left and bought more crypto. Since then, I’ve been able to repair my portfolio for the most part. 

And I'm not fcking selling.

I have tons of insane stories from that year - some really good and some really bad. I plan on writing them out someday, but right now I'm still traumatized.

Wow, that was cathartic. Anyway, love you. Do only good every day. ♥️🐶 Get help and take your meds.

What I didn't really understand back then and still don't today: How do I buy new coins (as easily as possible)?

I feel like gambling a bit and will probably lose everything, but nevertheless, I want to buy some  (Meme) coins that have just hit the market. All I remember from when I asked myself the same question before is that if I wanted to buy a coin for a few euros, I would have had to spend much more money on gas fees. Additionally, the whole buying and selling process was quite complicated.

So, how can I buy new coins easily and without paying too much in gas fees? Is that even possible? Thanks"

Ask Us Anything!",2024-04-10 20:36:48.000000,"Hey there, r/CC! We're thrilled to introduce you to addrs, a game-changing platform in the world of crypto payments.

You're likely familiar with the hassles of dealing with long, complex cryptocurrency addresses. addrs simplifies this process, making transactions as easy as clicking a link. Picture a Linktree for your crypto addresses - that's addrs!

What is addrs? addrs is a groundbreaking platform where users can consolidate all their cryptocurrency addresses a single payment profile. This means no more juggling multiple addresses - everything you need is in one spot.

How addrs Works: Create your unique payment profile link on addrs, which holds all your cryptocurrency addresses. Share this link, and when clicked, it directly opens the sender's wallet app, automatically filling in your address. Goodbye to the days of manually typing out those long strings!

Universal Compatibility: addrs plays well with a variety of wallets. It's compatible with almost all wallets, ensuring broad compatibility.

Security and Control: We prioritize your security. As a non-custodial platform, addrs never holds your cryptocurrency or private keys, granting you full control and an added layer of security.

Additional Features: Apart from simplifying transactions, addrs allows for crypto receiving via Visa/MasterCard/Bank, depositing directly into your wallet without the need for a custodial account.

Easy Integration on Your Site: Embedding addrs on your site is a breeze. Just use our [embed.addrs.to](https://embed.addrs.to) embeds, and you're set. Here's a sample for quick integration:

`<iframe src=""https://embed.addrs.to/pr0/eth""/>`

Beyond Payments: Don't miss out on our latest feature - Payment Requests! Now, even without an addrs account, you can generate a payment request. Just pick a token, set the amount, and share the secure link that opens the payer's wallet pre-filled with all the details. It's the simplicity of Web2 for the Web3 world.

For Developers: addrs isn't just user-friendly; it's a developer's ally too. Integrate our simple payment request links into your websites or apps, offering your users a seamless crypto payment experience.

To give you a concrete example, imagine you're a graphic designer who wants to accept ETH for your work. With addrs, you simply create a payment profile and share your unique link with your client. They click, confirm the amount, and boom - ETH arrives in your wallet. No more dictating addresses over the phone or triple-checking for typos!

So is your tech layer dependent? Do you operate on layer 1, or is this a layer 2 service? Can the payments be between different layers or chains? u/coinsRus-2021  
We are not. Both.

Good concept, and informative post. Any relation with (or inspiration from) ENS?Am one of the first ENS users, own pay.eth/hey.eth/devs.eth. The problems that ENS still req u to put in the ENS, which becomes a prob as adoption inc. This:

* removes any address/ENS, just tap a link, wallet opens with address ready.
* its free, no fees
* network agnostic - not just ETH focused

u/Hsiang7  
How does the sending of such crypto work then for any wallet that isn't an web wallet integrted into your browser since you need authorization from your personal wallet to send funds, or is a web wallet such as Metamask needed to use the service?  
Is addrs compatible with all wallets?  
addrs is compatible with any BTC/ETH wallet that follows BIP20 for Bitcoin or EIP 67/681 for Ethereum, as well as most protocols, making it widely compatible with different wallets. If they use uri, its supported

u/ApprehensiveHumor237  
How does addrs gain revenue? Do you collect a fee for each processed transaction? If yes, how much?  
Its free I have other projects to gen way more than this could. [https://keychain.me/](https://keychain.me/)  
Theres a fee for the onramp sometimes, but its only for fiat payments.  
  
[Kindly-Wolf6919](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kindly-Wolf6919/)

Firstly, I think you're onto something great here. Secondly, will this project continue to be expanded? I'm not sure if I missed it but there doesn't seem to be a feature to send payments? Say, for example, if I wanted to send some cash to another addrs account it'd be nice if I was able to have something like an address book where I can save names and their respective addrs accounts for easy use. Also, does your platform offer additional layers of security such as 2FA etc?  
Its not a wallet, most wallets already have this, we also dont track payments so this would not be possible. Not atm."

I believe once proof of work coins gain enough traction and a large enough network is created they can’t be stopped. Game theory strongly supports this. 

Coins that meet this criteria are: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. 

That’s just my opinion. Would love to hear everyone else thoughts and reasoning why their coins of choice have staying power."

More than 10 years ago DOGE got popular as the first meme coin. But there were no exchanges yet, or at least no alt-coin exchanges that would simply feature a lot of coins. At that time, you were able to mine a million DOGE coins per day with a simple GPU rig. As the coin got popular, trading started to happen on the forums of the coin's website - see screenshot.

&#x200B;

[Doge Forums more than 10 years ago](https://preview.redd.it/gtmpwedvv1tc1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0ea32c77e9d963308c32da8ed0c803c3d7f4fa3)

Doge was actually the start of a meme coin season back in 2013. If you think about it, not much has changed :) . I did a few trade via the forums and it was an experience to say the least. You would get into contact with a random other person and you trade in increments, to make sure no one got scammed. Of course, people would even scam you for small increments. How we dealt with that was to give people on the forum a 'trust-rating'. So people with a good trust rating could (kind of) be trusted.

However, it was clear that with popularity increasing more trading options were needed. So people started to offer themselves as escrows. This worked fine, but again it was clear that this was all quite the hassle. And that was basically when the first 'meme-coin' exchange was born. Someone programmed an exchanged called 'CoinedUp' where you could trade DOGE. It was very ugly, and looked like the design was done in MSPaint. But it worked! Shortly after, other meme coins came out and were added to CoinedUp. Mind you, these exchanged were buggy as well. Nowadays you cannot imagine that if you quickly want to sell something, you just dump it on the 'market'. Back then, that didn't work and people learned the hard way. If you would sell something for 0, it would actually fill a bid from someone that was buying for literally 0.

It was fun. Shorty after that other exchanges started to pop up, quickly becoming more 'professional'. 

For people that joined crypto later and wonder why DOGE has 'value' , well, this is it. It was the first ever meme coin with important history.

I've been diving deep into the world of cryptocurrencies and stumbled upon an intriguing theory I wanted to share and discuss with you all.

Key Points:

1. Shared Vision: Both Elon Musk and the creator(s) of Bitcoin advocate for a decentralized financial system.

2. Influence on Dogecoin: Elon's tweets and endorsements have significantly impacted Dogecoin's value and popularity.

3. Cryptic Nature and Twitter Activity: Elon's cryptic tweets about Dogecoin and cryptocurrencies could hint at his involvement as Satoshi.

4. Logo Similarities: The ""X"" in Xs (Twitter) logo similar to original PayPal logo, raising questions about Elon's early interest in digital payments.

5. Early Adoption by PayPal: PayPal's attempt to incorporate Bitcoin earlier than other platforms suggests Elon's early involvement in the crypto space.

6. Leverage Over Traditional Systems: Elon's influence in the crypto market gives him leverage over big corporations and government money, potentially leading to less resistance against decentralized finance.

7. Bitcoin Halving Coincidence: The Bitcoin halving coinciding with DogeDay/4/20 seems too perfect to be a coincidence, possibly emphasizing the significance of Dogecoin and Elon's role as Satoshi.


Discussion:


While there's no concrete evidence to support this theory, the similarities in vision, influence, and the significant impact Elon has on the cryptocurrency market make it an intriguing possibility worth exploring.

I'd love to hear your thoughts! Do you think there's any truth to this theory, or is it just another wild crypto conspiracy?"

Dogecoin,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bq7s3n/comparing_ravencoin_and_dogecoin/,1bq7s3n,Comparing Ravencoin and Dogecoin,2024-03-28 21:49:53.000000,"Comparing Ravencoin and Dogecoin involves examining various aspects such as their technology, purpose, community, and potential for long-term value. Here's why some might argue that Ravencoin is better than Dogecoin:

1. **Purpose and Use Case**: Ravencoin was specifically designed to facilitate the transfer of assets from one party to another on its blockchain. It aims to enable users to create and trade digital assets (tokens) securely and efficiently. On the other hand, Dogecoin started as a meme coin and lacks a defined purpose beyond being a digital currency for tipping and community engagement.
2. **Technology and Features**: Ravencoin is built on a fork of the Bitcoin codebase but includes additional features tailored for asset issuance and transfer. Its blockchain is optimized for asset ownership and transfer, making it suitable for various applications like tokenization of real-world assets, securities, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Dogecoin, while based on Litecoin, doesn't offer any significant technological advancements compared to other cryptocurrencies.
3. **Decentralization**: Both Ravencoin and Dogecoin are decentralized cryptocurrencies. However, the distribution of Ravencoin tends to be more widely dispersed among its users compared to Dogecoin, where a significant portion of the supply is held by a few large holders.
4. **Community and Development**: While both projects have active communities, Ravencoin's community tends to focus more on the development and adoption of the platform for various use cases beyond simple transactions. This active development and community engagement could potentially lead to more significant long-term utility for Ravencoin compared to Dogecoin, which relies heavily on its meme status.
5. **Scalability and Security**: Ravencoin's blockchain is designed with asset issuance and transfer in mind, which may lead to better scalability for its specific use case compared to Dogecoin's more generalized approach. Additionally, Ravencoin's development team is continuously working on enhancing the protocol's security features, which is crucial for its role in asset issuance and transfer.
6. **Long-Term Viability**: While Dogecoin has gained popularity and has a strong community following, its long-term viability as a serious investment or utility token is uncertain due to its lack of significant technological innovation and clear use case beyond being a meme. Ravencoin, with its focus on asset issuance and transfer, may have more potential for long-term viability and utility in various industries."

They are realizing NFTs are worthless and no one wants to overpay for digital art anymore. They are beginning to understand that layer 2s just complicate things and don’t work correctly. And that tokenazation, of real-estate, for example, is a tax nightmare. 

You know what coin has done great without the need for any buzz words? Bitcoin. You know what coin will continue to do great without any buzzwords? Bitcoin. 

You know what other coins will do great without any buzzwords? Coins that are similar to bitcoin. Coins like Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. 

These coins have stood the test of time, have 100 percent uptime, and are extremely secure and decentralized. They are great stores of value, and are used as currencies. 

I’m fully ready for the downvotes and comments like: dinocoins, clonecoins, LMAO, bag holder looking for copium. Save it. 

Coins that don’t depend on buzzwords to succeed, will succeed."

It looks like we are going to witness a little revolution about ""Litecoin"". Many people don´t even remember Litecoin being Top #3, #Top10, they remember him as some old OG coin for boomers, easy to transact with, but ""store of value? hah A) Charlie Sold B) It didn´t have a major price move"".  


Well If I am going to tell you, we had to let it cook for a while.... for 11 long years (mainly last 7 between post 2017 bullrun and today).  


This is the magic chart: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/LTCBTC/D6Uum4sj-10-year-wedge-about-to-break/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/LTCBTC/D6Uum4sj-10-year-wedge-about-to-break/)  


It goes all the way back into October 2013, 3D candles. Litecoin has been in dowtrend FOREVER in crypto space.  
There are still believers, that due to supply (BTC 21M and LTC 84M), the real Litecoin price should be BTC/4 = 0.25 LTC/BTC  


In 2024, in a world where people are searching for the next 100x meme coin, or Layer 7 DeFi on ETH channel, there is a quiet change of pace. Litecoin is rebounding from 0.001175 LTC/BTC (28th Feb) to todays value of 0.001375-0.001345 LTC/BTC.  


To breakout of this eternal damnation, LTC/BTC has to hold for tommorow somewhere above 0.001337+.  


I am not saying, that LTC can go to 0.25 at ratio, but... we could 30x-**50x** our Bitcoin and we would be still at only 0.065 LTC/BTC (50% above last ratio high at 0.04) **a move that Dogecoin did against Bitcoin in it´s own eternal damnation downtrend... until it mooned.**

We've seen the power of community banding together making Moons true decentralized thriving project since Reddit renounced their contract and burned **43M Moons (34%)**.

  Celer is providing incentives for bridge LPs: **285,000 CELER tokens.** 

 Camelot is offering **additional incentives** to DEX LPs in the form of their native token GRAIL + additional ARB rewards.

CELER and Camelot **have not yet** announced (tweeted) about this!

**2. Reddit IPO** is bringing attention to Moons as Reddit Native token, with trading starting on 21st of March

Reddit IPO is bringing hype for Moons as Reddit IPO is one of the biggest IPOs of the year

**3.  Distributions and tipping** return and finalizing setting up a **legal wrapper in form of DAO LLC is coming!**

Distributions return is in process, currently being tested in r/CryptoCurrencyMoons.

**Unique and core Moons feature** of getting something in return for one's contributions! Idea suggest a decade ago by Vitalik himself:

Vitalik also talked about the decentralized reputation based social network system in Ethereum unveiling in 2014!

**5.** Moons are now **hard capped @** total supply of **80,308,658 Moons**  and **deflationary** with **2,474,278** [in burn address](https://nova.arbiscan.io/token/0x0057ac2d777797d31cd3f8f13bf5e927571d6ad0?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)

 Almost 500k Moons burned in 2024, **\~0.625%** of the supply!

**7.** Moons **are a governance token of biggest crypto internet community!**

**8.** Moons **have never been in a bullrun on mainnet**. We will now see them perform for the first time!

**9.**  Moons have gotten scarcer and will be much harder to earn in the future! Owning **3.82** **Moons** **is equal to owning 1 BTC** in terms of percentage at current supply, owning **1786 Dogecoins is equal to owning 1 Moon**!

1 Moon / 80,308,658  x 100 =  0.00000124519

x/  143,496,626,383  x 100 = 0.00000124519

x =0.00000124519/100 \* 143,496,626,383

Moons are a perfect balance of real token with more utility most coins out there while being meme-able

**11.  Moons** capture value we create through our contributions and are being frontrunners in **bridging WEB 2 and WEB3** changing the way we use social apps! Now it's us user's getting payed for ads targeted at us!

**12.** Moons have **intangible value!**

Back in 17th century Europeans traded with New England Natives, the natives didn't use silver or gold, they used durable skeleton parts of animals they hunted down. It was mostly sea-shell money - wampum. Wampump then spread far away from clam's habitat into other tribes. They also made artful blades and necklessess. Blades that weren't made for cutting but for sheer enjoyment. Collecting and decorating things originates all back to Africa. People like doing things for fun, it's irrational and not practical but we do it. We trade with it or pass it to our children. Like some animals, humans learned that non-kin altruism grew community stronger. 

We put our feelings, thoughts and knowledge into our contributions and grow, protect and guide our community. As we did **after sunset**. We as a community create then capture that value!

Earning Moons is proof of our contributions to the community and reputation that can be carried across the web once other apps start displaying social tokens!

**13.** There are plans of **expanding Moons to other platforms in the next 12 months**!

**14.** Moons have **small mcap** and small circulating supply in comparison to many other tokens!

* If **Moons** had  **Bonk**'s market cap of **$1.6B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$20.51**, an upside of **58x**  
* If  **Moons** had **dogwifhat**'s market cap of **$2.2B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$26.78**, an upside of **76x**
* If **Moons** had  **Shiba Inu**'s market cap of **$14.5B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$180.61**, an upside of **518x**
* If  **Moons** had  **Dogecoin**'s market cap of **$20.3B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$252.39**, an upside of **725x** 
* If  **Moons** had  **Dogecoin**'s ATH market cap of **$88B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$1060**

**15.** Moons have **yet to be listed** on several big exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin

CZ already took notice of Moons while Moons were still on testnet

Asking for advice.",2024-03-16 01:31:24.000000,"I want to create a fun meme coin, similar to Dogecoin, that stands on its own like **Dogecoin**. I’m thinking of naming it **AMOGUS COIN**, inspired by the popular **Amogus** meme from the game **Among Us**. In the game, there are 15 players, and among them, 3 are impostors.

Here’s my concept: Each mined block will contain **20% impostor coins**. These impostor coins can suddenly disappear without a trace, just like impostors in the game. The tokens can be sent and received, but neither the sender nor the recipient will know which coins are impostors. The disappearance of impostor coins will be determined during mining and transaction confirmation.

The process of creating new coins will also include generating **20% impostor coins**, which will eventually be eliminated. For example, when we reach block 10 in the blockchain, we decide to eliminate impostors from block 6. The marked impostor coins will be removed, regardless of their wallet location. After this process, coins originating from the block where they were created will be considered safe and free from impostors.

During transactions, senders and recipients won’t know which coins are impostors and which are genuine.

My plan is for mining per block to last only **1 minute**. Each mining session will produce **1 million coins**, with **200,000 impostor coins**. There’s no limit to the total number of coins, similar to Dogecoin. The block reward will decrease by **20% every 100,000 blocks**, while the number of impostor coins created remains constant. For instance, if halving occurs at block 100,001, the total coins produced will be 800,000, with 160,000 impostor tokens per block.

What do you think? What can be improved, or any other idea before I started?

* Have a *strong* relationship with their native networks
* Price performance is similar to a meme going viral on the internet.

All three coins are variations of bitcoin. Bitcoin is the best blockchain in the world, hands down, no questions asked. These variations can be seen as good or bad, but at the end of the day the main frame is the same and they all use proof of work.

If it's not proof of work it's not a commodity or a currency, it's a security. I am so tired of these centralized alt-coins pretending that they are a blockchain. They are a company that is selling you made up internet money. They might as well be Kohls offering Kohl's cash. It's junk.

Proof of work requires real world energy to create a token. That makes it REAL. If I am buying a currency I want it to be backed up by REAL world assets. Just like USD is backed up by real guns, tanks and jets. I don't want it to be backed up by ""validators"" aka venture capitalists who bought into some project early on and have full control of the protocol. That's what the stock market is for.

Another beautiful part of these 4 coins is that anyone can run a node. That is the true key to their decentralization. The consensus mechanism has two independent parts, nodes and miners. These two parts work in perfect harmony. Whereas a proof of stake chain like Ethereum simply has validators that vote on the future of the chain.

Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin and bitcoin cash are the main proof of work chains we have today and they will be around for ever in my opinion. All four are like a different model Mercedes. All serving different purposes.

I know a lot of bitcoin maxis don't think this way. But I think it's time that they do. At the end of the day proof of work is the genius behind bitcoin, and having multiple proof of work chains thrive is important.

I think all four will thrive! I cannot say the same about your favorite proof of stake coin."

Will there be more crypto ETFs in the near future? If so, what coins will be next? 

What will be the biggest obstacles for another crypto ETF? 

I think it will come down to the SECs decision on what cryptos are securities and which cryptos are commodities. In my opinion, I think coins that are commodities will become ETFs. It would be very difficult to create an ETF for unregistered securities. 

This brings me to my next question. What cryptos other than bitcoin will be considered commodities by the SEC? Will all proof of work coins be considered commodities? Like, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash, or Monero.

I think the SEC will also consider other factors like how the coin was initially released and how the consensus mechanism works. 

What other factors do you think the SEC will consider when deciding what crypto will become an ETF next? 

Curious what everyone thinks. Also, what timeline do you see this happening? "

A guy make a million dollars in 2020 then gamble his family's home away (even though it also had a million of equity)

My close friend sell his btc and eth near the bottom, but decide to rent a luxury apartment (his parents live in the same city). 35, no assets now.

My OG friend buy 3 btc at $2,000 each, only to sell them at $8,000. Can never get to that level again.

Me: Sell my condo with a $550/mortgage and $400 month positive cash flow because I had too much debt, only to see the property +90% since then (2020). Can never get that investment again.

If you are heavy into crypto, you most likely have a longer term time horizon, an idea of delayed gratification, and long term investing. HOWEVER, you are also more likely to see huge gains and wealth at a relatively young age.

I think this is a very difficult thing to deal with (first world problems). However, it is an issue.

I highly encourage you to tell no one about your crypto. NO one. Your wife will want to spend it, your boss will hate that you are wealthier than him (who knows, maybe he panic sold), your friends will envy you. It is the natural course. If you need to tell someone, tell them you have 10% of what you actually have.

I have no problems with Ferraris and rolexes-but please, for the love of God, protect yourself. Get a small house. Get solar. Get a small electric car. You have no car bill, no electric bill, no fuel bill, no house bill. You have unlocked freedom. 

In fact, you can now easily invest in crashes because you don't need to be short term oriented.

Keep your W2  job. Even if you work in a crazy, dysfunctional environment. I know a guy who walked away out of pride from a job that could have made him easily $6,000 a month. he lived with parents. he wasn't a spender. Imagine after taxes dca'ing $3500-4000 a month. FOR THE LAST 4 YEARS.

Keep your ego in check. This isn't just relative to crypto. The easiest way to get wealthy is to NOT WASH OUT. I know many men who during most of their life made very, very good incomes but leveraged themselves up. They had to restart their entire financial life after 2008. For those in crypto, I know someone who had to restart their financial life after 2017, then again in April 2020.

please for the love of all that is holy stay away from leveraged trading.

P.S. I know a guy who put $2,500 in to dogecoin and it was worth $750k at the top. I own Doge. What shocks me is he didn't take at least 100-200k to buy a house."
